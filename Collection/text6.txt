Christ is born of Mary—She conceives
by the power of the Holy Ghost—Our
Lord is named Jesus.
The book of the generation of
Jesus Christ, the son of a David,
the son of Abraham.
2 a Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac
begat Jacob; and Jacob begat b Judas
and his brethren;
3 And Judas begat a Phares and b Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
c Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
4 And Aram begat Aminadab;
and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
a Naasson begat Salmon;
5 And Salmon begat a Booz of
Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of
Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
6 And Jesse begat David the king;
and David the king begat a Solomon
of her that had been the wife of Urias;
7 And Solomon begat Roboam;
and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
begat Asa;
8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and
Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
begat Ozias;
9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and
Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
begat Ezekias;
10 And Ezekias begat Manasses;
and Manasses begat Amon; and
Amon begat Josias;
11 And Josias begat Jechonias and
his brethren, about the time they
were carried away to a Babylon:
12 And after they were brought to
Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;
and Salathiel begat a Zorobabel;
13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and
Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim
begat Azor;
14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
Eliud;
15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and
Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan
begat Jacob;
16 And Jacob begat a Joseph the
husband of b Mary, of whom was
born c Jesus, d who is called e Christ.
17 So all the generations from
Abraham to David are fourteen
generations; and from David un­ til the carrying away into Babylon
are fourteen generations; and from
the carrying away into Babylon
unto Christ are fourteen a generations.

Joseph, before they came together,
she was found with child of the
Holy Ghost.
19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
make her a publick a example, b was
minded to c put her away privily.
20 But while he thought on these
things, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a a dream,
saying, Joseph, thou son of b David,
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
wife: for that which is conceived in
her is of the c Holy Ghost.
21 And she shall bring forth a
son, and thou shalt call his a name b Jesus: for he shall c save his people
from their sins.
22 Now all this was done, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken
of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
23 a Behold, a b virgin shall be with
child, and shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call his c name d Em- manuel, which being interpreted
is, God with us.
24 Then Joseph being raised from
sleep did as the angel of the Lord
had bidden him, and took unto him
his a wife:
25 And knew her not till she had
brought forth her a firstborn son: and
he called his name Jesus.
Chapter 2
The wise men are directed by a star
to Jesus—Joseph takes the child to
Egypt—Herod slays the children in
Bethlehem—Jesus is taken to Naza- reth to dwell.
Now when Jesus was a born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod
the king, behold, there came wise
men from the east to Jerusalem,
2 Saying, a Where is he that is born b King of the Jews? for we have seen
his c star in the east, and are come
to d worship him.
3 When Herod the king had heard
these things, he was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him.
4 a And when he had gathered all
the chief priests and scribes of the
people together, he b demanded of
them where Christ should be born.
5 And they said unto him, In Beth- lehem of Judæa: for thus it is written by the prophet,
6 And thou a Bethlehem, in the land
of b Juda, art not the least among
the princes of Juda: for out of thee
shall come a c Governor, that shall d rule my people Israel.
7 Then Herod, when he had priv- ily called the wise men, inquired
of them diligently what time the
star appeared.
8 And he sent them to Bethlehem,
and said, Go and search diligently
for the young child; and when ye
have found him, bring me word
again, that I may come and worship
him also.
9 When they had heard the king,
they departed; and, lo, the star,
which they saw in the east, went

before them, till it came and stood
over where the young child was.
10 When they saw the star, they
rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
11 ¶ And when they were come
into the house, they saw the young
child with Mary his mother, and
fell down, and worshipped him:
and when they had opened their
treasures, they presented unto him
gifts; gold, and a frankincense, and
myrrh.
12 And being warned of God in a a dream that they should not return
to Herod, they departed into their
own country another way.
13 And when they were departed,
behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt,
and be thou there until I bring thee
word: for Herod will seek the young
child to destroy him.
14 When he arose, he took the
young child and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt:
15 And was there until the death
of Herod: that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken of the Lord by
the prophet, saying, Out of a Egypt
have I called my son.
16 ¶ Then Herod, when he saw
that he was a mocked of the wise
men, b was exceeding wroth, and
sent forth, and c slew all the chil- dren that were in Bethlehem, and
in all the d coasts thereof, from two
years old and under, according to
the time which he had diligently
inquired of the wise men.
17 Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by a Jeremy the prophet,
saying,
18 In a Rama was there a voice
heard, lamentation, and weeping,
and great b mourning, Rachel weeping for her c children, and would not
be comforted, because they are not.
19 ¶ But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth
in a a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
20 Saying, Arise, and take the young
child and his mother, and go into
the a land of Israel: for they are dead
which sought the young child’s life.
21 And he arose, and took the
young child and his mother, and
came into the land of Israel.
22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judæa in the a room
of his father Herod, he was afraid
to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a b dream, he
turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
23 And he came and dwelt in a
city called a Nazareth: that it might
be fulfilled which was b spoken by
the prophets, He shall be called a
c Nazarene.
Chapter 3
John the Baptist preaches in Judæa—
Jesus is baptized, and the Father acclaims Him as His Beloved Son.
In those days came a John the Bap- tist, preaching in the wilderness
of Judæa,
2 And saying, a Repent ye: for the b kingdom of heaven c is at hand.
3 For this is he that was spoken
of by the prophet a Esaias, saying,
The b voice of one crying in the 
Matthew 3:4–4:2 1190
wilderness, c Prepare ye the way of
the Lord, make his d paths straight.
4 And the same John had his a raiment of b camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his
meat was c locusts and wild honey.
5 Then went out to him Jerusalem,
and all Judæa, and all the region
round about Jordan,
6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, a confessing their sins.
7 ¶ But when he saw many of the
Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
a baptism, he said unto them, O b generation of vipers, who hath c warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?
8 a Bring forth therefore fruits b meet for c repentance:
9 And think not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham a to
our father: for I say unto you, that
God is able of these stones to raise
up children unto Abraham.
10 And now also the axe is laid
unto the root of the trees: therefore
every tree which a bringeth not forth
good fruit is b hewn down, and cast
into the fire.
11 a I indeed b baptize you with water unto c repentance: but d he that
cometh after me is mightier than
I, whose shoes I am not e worthy to
bear: he shall f baptize you with the
Holy Ghost, and with g fire:
12 Whose a fan is in his hand, and
he will throughly purge his floor,
and gather his wheat into the b garner; but he will burn up the chaff
with unquenchable c fire.
13 ¶ Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be a baptized of him.
14 But John forbad him, saying, I
have need to be baptized of thee,
and comest thou to me?
15 a And Jesus answering said unto
him, b Suffer it to be so now: for thus
it c becometh us to d fulfil all e righteousness. Then he suffered him.
16 And Jesus, when he was a bap- tized, went up b straightway out of
the water: and, lo, the heavens were
opened unto him, and he saw the
c Spirit of God descending like a
d dove, and lighting upon him:
17 And lo a a voice from heaven,
saying, This is my b beloved c Son,
in whom I am well pleased.

and heals the sick.

days and forty nights, c he was afterward an hungred.
3 And when the a tempter came to
him, he said, If thou be the Son of
God, command that these stones be
made b bread.
4 But he answered and said, It
is written, a Man shall not b live by c bread alone, but by every d word
that proceedeth out of the e mouth
of God.
5 a Then the devil taketh him up
into the b holy city, and setteth him
on a pinnacle of the temple,
6 a And saith unto him, b If thou be
the Son of God, cast thyself down:
for it is written, He shall give his
angels charge concerning thee: and
in their hands they shall bear thee
up, lest at any time thou dash thy
foot against a stone.
7 Jesus said unto him, It is written
again, Thou shalt not a tempt the
Lord thy God.
8 a Again, the devil taketh him up
into an exceeding high mountain,
and sheweth him all the b kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
them;
9 a And saith unto him, All these
things will I give thee, if thou wilt
fall down and worship me.
10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get
thee hence, a Satan: for it is written,
Thou shalt b worship the Lord thy
God, and him only shalt thou serve.
11 Then the devil leaveth him, a and, behold, b angels came and
ministered unto him.
12 ¶ Now when Jesus had heard
that John was cast into prison, he
departed into a Galilee;
13 And leaving Nazareth, he came
and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
upon the sea coast, in the borders
of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
14 That it might be a fulfilled which
was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
saying,
15 The land of a Zabulon, and the
land of Nephthalim, by the way of
the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of
the Gentiles;
16 The people which sat in a darkness saw great b light; and to them
which sat in the region and shadow
of death light is sprung up.
17 ¶ From that time Jesus began
to a preach, and to say, b Repent: for
the c kingdom of heaven d is at hand.
18 ¶ And Jesus, walking by the
sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
Simon called Peter, and Andrew his
brother, casting a net into the sea:
for they were a fishers.
19 And he saith unto them, a Follow
me, and I will make you b fishers
of men.

20 And they straightway left their
nets, and a followed him.
21 And going on from thence, he
saw other two brethren, James the son
of a Zebedee, and John his brother,
in a ship with Zebedee their father,
mending their nets; and he b called
them.
22 And they immediately left the
ship and their father, and followed
him.
23 ¶ And Jesus went about all a Galilee, b teaching in their synagogues,
and c preaching the gospel of the
kingdom, and d healing all manner
of e sickness and all manner of dis- ease among the f people.
24 And his fame went throughout
all Syria: and they brought unto him
all sick people that were taken with
divers diseases and torments, and
those which were possessed with
a devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the b palsy;
and he c healed them.
25 And there followed him great
multitudes of people from Galilee,
and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judæa, and from
beyond Jordan.

Jesus preaches the Sermon on the
Mount—Its teachings replace and
transcend some aspects of the law of
Moses—All are commanded to be per- fect like their Father in Heaven.
a And seeing the multitudes, he went
up into a mountain: and when he
was set, his disciples came unto
him:
2 And he opened his mouth, and
taught them, saying,
3 a Blessed are the b poor in spirit:
for theirs is the c kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that a mourn: for
they shall be b comforted.
5 Blessed are the a meek: for they

7 Blessed are the a merciful: for they
shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the a pure in b heart:

9 Blessed are the a peacemakers:
for they shall be called the b children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are a per- secuted for b righteousness’ sake: for c theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

for so c persecuted they the prophets
which were before you.
13 ¶ Ye are the a salt of the earth:
but if the salt have lost his savour,
wherewith shall it be salted? it is
thenceforth good for nothing, but
to be cast out, and to be trodden
under foot of men.
14 Ye are the a light of the world.
A city that is set on an hill cannot
be hid.
15 Neither do men light a a candle,
and put it under a bushel, but on a
candlestick; and it giveth light unto
all that are in the house.
16 Let your a light so shine before
men, that they may see your good
b works, and c glorify your Father
which is in heaven.
17 ¶ Think not that I am come to a destroy the b law, or the prophets:
I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.
18 For verily I say unto you, Till
heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from
the a law, till all be b fulfilled.
19 aWhosoever therefore shall bbreak one of these least commandments, and shall c teach men so,
he shall be called the least in the
kingdom of heaven: but whosoever
shall do and d teach them, the same
shall be called great in the kingdom
of heaven.
20 For I say unto you, That except
your a righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the b scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
into the kingdom of heaven.
21 ¶ Ye have heard that it was said
by them of old time, Thou a shalt not b kill; and whosoever shall kill shall
be c in danger of the judgment:
22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is a angry with his brother b without a cause shall be c in danger of the judgment: and whoso- ever shall say to his brother, d Raca,
shall be e in danger of the council:
but whosoever shall say, Thou fool,
shall be in danger of hell fire.
23 Therefore if thou bring thy
gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought
against thee;
24 Leave there thy gift before the
altar, and go thy way; first be a rec- onciled to thy brother, and then
come and offer thy gift.
25 a Agree with thine adversary
quickly, whiles thou art in the way
with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge,
and the judge deliver thee to the
officer, and thou be cast into prison.
26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou
shalt by no means come out thence,
till thou hast paid a the uttermost
farthing.

whosoever a looketh on a b woman to c lust after her hath committed d adultery with her already in his heart.
29 And if thy right eye a offend thee,
pluck it out, and cast it from thee:
for it is profitable for thee that one
of thy members should perish, and
not that thy whole body should be
cast into b hell.
30 And if thy right a hand offend
thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee:
for it is profitable for thee that one
of thy members should perish, and
not that thy whole body should be
cast into b hell.
31 It hath been said, Whosoever
shall put away his wife, let him
give her a writing of a divorcement:
32 But I say unto you, That who- soever shall a put away his b wife,
saving for the cause of c fornication,
causeth her to commit adultery: and
whosoever shall marry her that is
divorced committeth adultery.
33 ¶ Again, ye have heard that it
hath been said by them of old time,
Thou shalt not a forswear thyself,
but shalt b perform unto the Lord
thine c oaths:
34 But I say unto you, a Swear not
at all; neither by heaven; for it is
God’s b throne:
35 Nor by the earth; for it is his a footstool: neither by Jerusalem;
for it is the b city of the great King.
36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy
head, because thou canst not make

Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever
is more than these cometh b of evil.
38 ¶ Ye have heard that it hath
been said, An a eye for an eye, and

to him the other also.

45 That ye a may be the b children

Chapter 6
Jesus continues the Sermon on the
Mount—He teaches the disciples the
Lord’s Prayer—They are commanded
to seek first the kingdom of God and
His righteousness.
a Take heed that ye do not your b alms
before men, to be seen of them: oth- erwise ye have no reward of your
Father which is in heaven.
2 Therefore when thou doest thine
alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the a hypocrites do in
the synagogues and in the streets,
that they may have b glory of men.
Verily I say unto you, They have
their reward.
3 But when thou doest alms, let
not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth:
4 That thine a alms may be in
secret: and thy Father which seeth
in secret himself shall b reward thee
openly.
5 ¶ And when thou prayest, thou
shalt not be as the a hypocrites are:
for they love to pray standing in
the synagogues and in the corners
of the streets, that they may be seen
of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have their reward.
6 But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thy a closet, and when thou
hast b shut thy door, c pray to thy
Father which is in d secret; and
thy Father which e seeth in secret
shall f reward thee openly.
7 But when ye pray, use not vain a repetitions, as the b heathen do: for
they think that they shall be heard
for their much speaking.
8 Be not ye therefore like unto
them: for your Father a knoweth
what things ye have b need of, before ye ask him.
9 a After this manner therefore b pray ye: Our c Father which art in
heaven, d Hallowed be thy e name.
10 Thy a kingdom come. Thy b will be done c in earth, as it is in
heaven.
11 Give us this day our daily a bread.

13 a And b lead us not into c temptation, d but deliver us from evil: For
thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the e glory, for ever. Amen.
14 For if ye a forgive men their
trespasses, your heavenly Father
will also forgive you:
15 But if ye a forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses.
16 ¶ Moreover when ye fast, be not,
as the hypocrites, of a sad counte- nance: for they disfigure their faces,
that they may appear unto men to
a fast. Verily I say unto you, They
b have their reward.
17 But thou, when thou fastest,
anoint thine head, and wash thy
face;
18 That thou appear not unto men
to a fast, but unto thy Father which
is in secret: and thy Father, which
seeth in secret, shall b reward thee
openly.
19 ¶ Lay not up for yourselves a treasures upon earth, where moth
and rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves b break through and steal:
20 But lay up for yourselves a treasures in heaven, where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through nor
b steal:
21 For where your treasure is, there
will your heart be also.
22 The light of the body is the eye:
if therefore thine a eye be b single, thy
whole body shall be full of c light.
23 But if thine eye be evil, thy
whole body shall be full of dark- ness. If therefore the light that is
in thee be darkness, how great is
that a darkness!
24 ¶ a No man can b serve two c masters: for either he will d hate the
one, and love the other; or else he
will hold to the one, and despise
the other. Ye cannot serve God and
e mammon.
25 a Therefore I say unto you, Take
no b thought for your life, what ye
shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor
yet for your body, what ye shall put
on. Is not the life more than meat,
and the body than raiment?
26 Behold the fowls of the air: for
they sow not, neither do they reap,
nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye
not much better than they ?
27 Which of you by taking thought
can add one cubit unto his stature?
28 And why take ye thought for
raiment? a Consider the lilies of the
field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin:
29 And yet I say unto you, That
even Solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these.
30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the
grass of the field, which to day is,
and to morrow is cast into the oven,
a shall he not much more clothe you,
O ye of little b faith?

Chapter 7
Jesus concludes the Sermon on the
Mount—He commands, Judge not; ask
of God; beware of false prophets—He
promises salvation to those who do the
will of the Father.
a Judge not, that ye be not b judged.
2 For with what a judgment ye
judge, ye shall be judged: and with
what b measure ye mete, it shall be c measured to you again.
3 a And why beholdest thou the b mote that is in thy brother’s eye,
but considerest not the c beam that
is in thine own eye?
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy
brother, Let me pull out the mote
out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam
is in thine own eye?
5 Thou a hypocrite, first cast out
the beam out of thine own eye; and
then shalt thou see clearly to cast
out the mote out of thy brother’s
eye.
6 ¶ a Give not that which is b holy
unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
c pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn
again and rend you.
7 ¶ a Ask, and it shall be b given you; c seek, and ye shall find; d knock, and
it shall be opened unto you:
8 For every one that asketh receiv- eth; and he that a seeketh findeth;
and to him that knocketh it shall
be opened.
9 Or what man is there of you,

how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your

ye would that b men should c do to
you, d do ye even so to them: for this
is the e law and the prophets.
13 ¶ Enter ye in at the a strait b gate:
for wide is the gate, and broad is the
way, that leadeth to c destruction, and
many there be which go in thereat:
14 Because a strait is the b gate, and
narrow is the way, which leadeth
unto c life, and few there be that
find it.
15 ¶ Beware of a false prophets,
which come to you in b sheep’s
clothing, but c inwardly they are
ravening d wolves.
16 Ye shall a know them by their b fruits. Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles?
17 Even so every good tree bringeth
forth a good b fruit; but a c corrupt tree
bringeth forth d evil fruit.
18 A good tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.
19 Every tree that bringeth not
forth good a fruit is b hewn down,
and cast into the fire.
20 Wherefore by their a fruits ye
shall know them.
21 ¶ Not every one that a saith unto
me, b Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that c doeth the d will of my Father which is
in e heaven.
22 Many will say to me in that day,
Lord, Lord, have we not a prophesied
in thy name? and in thy b name have
cast out devils? and in thy name
done many wonderful works?
23 a And then will I profess unto
them, I never knew you: b depart

29 For he taught them as one having a authority, and not as b the scribes.
Chapter 8
Jesus heals a leper, cures the centurion’s
servant and others, stills the tempest,
and casts out devils—The devils enter
a herd of swine.
When he was come down from the
mountain, great multitudes followed him.
2 And, behold, there came a a leper
and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
if thou wilt, thou canst make me
clean.
3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and
touched him, saying, I will; be thou
clean. And immediately his leprosy
was a cleansed.
4 And Jesus saith unto him, See
thou tell no man; but go thy way,
shew thyself to the priest, and offer
the gift that Moses commanded, for
a testimony unto them.
5 ¶ And when Jesus was entered
into Capernaum, there came unto
him a centurion, beseeching him,
6 And saying, Lord, my a servant
lieth at home sick of the b palsy,
grievously tormented.
7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will
come and heal him.
8 The centurion answered and said,
Lord, I am not a worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof: but
speak the word only, and my servant shall be b healed.
9 For I am a man under a authority,
having soldiers under me: and I say
to this man, Go, and he goeth; and
to another, Come, and he cometh;
and to my servant, Do this, and he
doeth it.
10 a When Jesus heard it, he mar- velled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have
not found so great b faith, no, not
in Israel.
11 And I say unto you, That a many
shall come from the east and west,
and shall sit down with Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
12 But the a children of the king- dom shall be cast out into b outer
darkness: there shall be c weeping
and gnashing of teeth.
13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee.
And his servant was healed in the
selfsame hour.
14 ¶ And when Jesus was come
into Peter’s house, he saw his a wife’s
mother b laid, and sick of a fever.
15 And he a touched her hand, and

ministered unto them.
16 ¶ When the even was come, they

17 That it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
saying, a Himself took our b infirmities, and bare our c sicknesses.
18 ¶ Now when Jesus saw great
multitudes about him, he gave
commandment to depart unto the
other side.
19 And a certain scribe came, and
said unto him, Master, I will a follow
thee whithersoever thou goest.
20 And Jesus saith unto him, The
foxes have holes, and the birds of
the air have nests; but the Son of
man hath not where to lay his head.
21 And another of his disciples said
unto him, Lord, a suffer me first to
go and bury my father.
22 But Jesus said unto him, a Fol- low me; and let the b dead bury
their dead.
23 ¶ And when he was entered into
a ship, his disciples followed him.
24 And, behold, there arose a great a tempest in the sea, insomuch that
the ship was covered with the waves:
but he was asleep.
25 And his disciples came to him,
and awoke him, saying, Lord, save
us: we perish.
26 And he saith unto them, Why
are ye a fearful, O ye of little faith?
Then he arose, and b rebuked the
winds and the sea; and there was a
great calm.
27 But the men marvelled, say- ing, What manner of man is this,
that even the winds and the a sea
obey him!
28 ¶ And when he was come to
the other side into the country of
the Gergesenes, there met him two
possessed with a devils, coming out
of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so
that no man might pass by that way.
29 And, behold, they cried out,
saying, What have we to do with
thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art
thou come hither to torment us before a the time?
30 And there was a good way off
from them an herd of many swine
feeding.
31 So the devils besought him,
saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us
to go away into the herd of swine.
32 And he said unto them, Go.
And when they were come out, they
went into the herd of swine: and,
behold, the whole herd of swine ran
violently down a steep place into
the sea, and perished in the waters.
33 And they that kept them fled,
and went their ways into the city, and
told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.
34 And, behold, the whole city
came out to a meet Jesus: and when
they saw him, they besought him that
he would depart out of their b coasts.
Chapter 9
Jesus forgives sins, heals a paralytic,
and calls Matthew—Jesus eats with sin- ners, heals a woman who touches His
garments, and raises Jairus’s daughter
to life—He opens the eyes of the blind,
casts out a devil, and preaches the gospel.
And he entered into a ship, and
passed over, and came into his own
city.
2 And, behold, they brought to him
a man sick of the a palsy, lying on
a bed: and Jesus seeing their b faith
said unto the sick of the palsy; Son,
be of good c cheer; thy d sins be forgiven thee.

6 But that ye may know that the a Son of man hath b power on earth
to c forgive sins, (then saith he to
the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up

7 And he arose, and departed to
his house.
8 But when the multitudes saw
it, they marvelled, and glorified
God, which had given such power
unto men.
9 ¶ And as Jesus passed forth
from thence, he saw a man, named
a Matthew, sitting at the b receipt of
custom: and he saith unto him, Fol- low me. And he arose, and followed
him.
10 ¶ And it came to pass, as Jesus sat
at meat in the house, behold, many
publicans and sinners came and sat
down with him and his disciples.
11 And when the Pharisees saw it,
they said unto his disciples, a Why
eateth your Master with publicans
and sinners?
12 But when Jesus heard that, he
said unto them, They that be whole
need not a physician, but they that
are sick.
13 But go ye and learn what that
meaneth, a I b will have c mercy, and
not sacrifice: for I am not come to
d call the e righteous, but sinners to
f repentance.
14 ¶ Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we
and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy
disciples fast not?
15 And Jesus said unto them, Can
the children of the bridechamber
mourn, as long as the bridegroom
is with them? but the days will
come, when the bridegroom shall
be taken from them, a and then shall
they fast.
16 a No man putteth a piece of b new
cloth unto an old garment, for that
which is put in to fill it up taketh
from the garment, and the rent is
made worse.
17 Neither do men put new wine
into old bottles: else the bottles
break, and the wine runneth out,
and the bottles perish: but they put
new wine into new bottles, and both
are preserved.
18 ¶ While he spake these things
unto them, behold, there came a
certain a ruler, and worshipped him,
saying, b My daughter is even now
dead: but come and lay thy c hand
upon her, and she shall d live.
19 And Jesus arose, and followed
him, and so did his disciples.
20 ¶ And, behold, a woman, which
was diseased with an a issue of b blood
twelve years, came behind him, and
touched the hem of his garment:
21 For she said within herself, If I
may but touch his garment, I shall
be a whole.
22 But Jesus turned him about,
and when he saw her, he said,
Daughter, be of good comfort; thy
faith hath made thee a whole. And
the woman was made whole from
that hour.
23 And when Jesus came into the
ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels
and the people making a noise,
24 He said unto them, Give place:
for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.
And they a laughed him to scorn.

abroad into all that land.
27 ¶ And when Jesus departed
thence, two blind men followed
him, crying, and saying, Thou Son
of David, have mercy on us.
28 And when he was come into the
house, the a blind men came to him:
and Jesus saith unto them, b Believe
ye that I am able to do this? They
said unto him, Yea, Lord.
29 Then touched he their eyes,
saying, According to your a faith be

30 And their a eyes were b opened;
and Jesus c straitly charged them,
saying, See that no man know it.
31 But they, when they were departed, a spread abroad his b fame in
all that country.
32 ¶ As they went out, behold,
they brought to him a dumb man
possessed with a a devil.
33 And when the devil was cast
out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was
never so seen in Israel.
34 But the Pharisees said, He
casteth out devils through the prince
of the devils.
35 And Jesus went about all the
cities and villages, a teaching in
their synagogues, and preaching
the b gospel of the kingdom, and c healing every sickness and every
disease among the people.
36 ¶ But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with a compassion on them, because b they fainted,
and were scattered abroad, as c sheep
having no d shepherd.
37 Then saith he unto his disciples,
The a harvest truly is plenteous, but
the b labourers are few;
38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of
the harvest, that he will send forth
labourers into his harvest.
Chapter 10
Jesus instructs and empowers the
Twelve Apostles and sends them forth
to preach, minister, and heal the sick—
Those who receive the Twelve receive
the Lord.
And when he had a called unto him
his b twelve disciples, he gave them c power against d unclean spirits, to
cast them out, and to e heal all manner of f sickness and all manner of
disease.
2 Now the names of the twelve

who is called Peter, and Andrew his
brother; James the son of Zebedee,
and John his brother;

the son of Alphæus, and Lebbæus,

6 But go rather to the a lost b sheep
of the house of Israel.
7 And as ye go, preach, saying,
The kingdom of heaven a is at hand.
8 a Heal the sick, cleanse the b lepers, raise the dead, c cast out devils: d freely ye have received, freely e give.
9 Provide neither gold, nor silver,
nor brass in your a purses,
10 Nor a scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet
staves: for the workman is b worthy
of his c meat.
11 And into whatsoever city or
town ye shall a enter, inquire who
in it is worthy; and there abide till
ye go thence.
12 And when ye come into an
house, salute it.
13 And if the house be worthy,
let your peace come upon it: but
if it be not worthy, let your peace
return to you.
14 And whosoever shall not receive
you, nor hear your words, when ye
depart out of that house or city,
shake off the a dust of your b feet.
15 Verily I say unto you, It shall
be more tolerable for the land of
a Sodom and Gomorrha in the day
of judgment, than for that city.
16 ¶ Behold, I send you forth as a sheep in the midst of wolves: be
ye therefore b wise as serpents, and c harmless as doves.
17 But beware of men: for they
will deliver you up to the councils,
and they will scourge you in their
synagogues;
18 And ye shall be brought before
governors and a kings b for my sake,
for a c testimony against them and
the Gentiles.
19 But when they deliver you up, a take no thought how or what ye
shall speak: for it shall be given
you in that same hour what ye shall
b speak.
20 For it is not ye that speak, but
the a Spirit of your Father which
speaketh in you.
21 And the brother shall deliver
up the brother to death, and the
father the child: and the children
shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death.
22 And ye shall be a hated of all men b for my c name’s sake: but he that d endureth to the end shall be saved.
23 But when they persecute you
in this city, flee ye into another: for
verily I say unto you, Ye shall not
have gone over the cities of Israel,
till the Son of man be come.
24 The a disciple is not above his

25 It is enough for the disciple a that

there is nothing a covered, that shall
not be revealed; and hid, that
shall not be known.
27 What I tell you in darkness, that
speak ye in light: and what ye hear
in the ear, that preach ye upon the
housetops.
28 And a fear not them which kill
the body, but are not able to kill the
soul: but rather b fear him which
is able to c destroy both d soul and
body in e hell.
29 Are not two a sparrows sold for
a farthing? and one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your
Father.
30 But the very a hairs of your head
are all numbered.
31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of
more a value than many b sparrows.
32 Whosoever therefore shall a confess me before men, him will I
confess also before my Father which
is in heaven.
33 But whosoever shall a deny me
before men, him will I also deny be- fore my Father which is in heaven.
34 Think not that I am come to
send a peace on earth: I came not
to send peace, but a sword.
35 For I am come to set a man at
variance against his father, and the
daughter against her mother, and
the daughter in law against her
mother in law.
36 And a man’s a foes shall be they
of his own b household.
37 He that a loveth father or mother
b more than me is not worthy of me:
and he that c loveth son or daughter
more than me is not worthy of me.
38 And he that taketh not his a cross, and followeth after me, is
not b worthy of me.
39 a He that findeth his life shall b lose it: and he that c loseth his d life
for my sake shall find it.
40 ¶ He that a receiveth you b receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me.
41 He that a receiveth a prophet
in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s b reward; and he
that receiveth a righteous man in
the name of a righteous man shall
receive a righteous man’s reward.
42 And whosoever shall give to
drink unto one of these little ones
a cup of cold water only in the a name of a disciple, verily I say unto
you, he shall in no wise b lose his
reward.

Jesus acclaims John as more than a
prophet—The cities of Chorazin, Beth- saida, and Capernaum are rebuked for
unbelief—The Son reveals the Father—
The yoke of Christ is easy, and His
burden is light.
And it came to pass, when Jesus
had made an end of commanding
his twelve disciples, he departed
thence to teach and to a preach in

2 Now when a John had heard in
the prison the works of Christ, he
sent two of his disciples,
3 And said unto him, Art thou he
that should come, or do we look for
another?
4 Jesus answered and said unto
them, Go and shew John again those
a things which ye do hear and see:
5 The a blind receive their b sight,
and the lame walk, the c lepers are
cleansed, and the deaf hear, the
dead are raised up, and the d poor
have the gospel preached to them.
6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall
not be a offended in me.
7 ¶ And as they departed, Jesus
began to say unto the multitudes
concerning John, What went ye out
into the wilderness to see? A reed
shaken with the wind?
8 But what went ye out for to see?
A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are
in a kings’ houses.
9 But what went ye out for to see?
A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and
more than a a prophet.
10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my a messenger
before thy face, which shall b prepare thy way before thee.
11 Verily I say unto you, Among
them that are born of a women there
hath not risen a greater than b John
the Baptist: c notwithstanding he that
is least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he.
12 And from the days of John the
Baptist until now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence, and a the
violent take it by force.
13 a For all the b prophets and the
law c prophesied until John.
14 And if ye will receive it, this is a Elias, which was for to come.
15 He that hath ears to a hear, let
him hear.
16 ¶ But whereunto shall I liken
this generation? It is like unto chil- dren sitting in the markets, and
calling unto their fellows,
17 And saying, We have piped
unto you, and ye have not danced;
we have mourned unto you, and ye
have not lamented.
18 For John came neither eating
nor drinking, and they say, He hath
a devil.
19 The Son of man came eating
and drinking, and they say, Behold
a man gluttonous, and a a winebibber, a friend of b publicans and sin- ners. But wisdom is justified c of
her children.
20 ¶ Then began he to upbraid the a cities wherein most of his mighty
works were done, because they re- pented not:
21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe
unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
mighty works, which were done
in you, had been done in Tyre and
Sidon, they would have a repented
long ago in sackcloth and b ashes.
22 But I say unto you, It shall be
more a tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
at the day of judgment, than for
you.
23 And thou, Capernaum, which
art a exalted unto heaven, shalt be
brought down to b hell: for if the
mighty works, which have been
done in thee, had been done in

and said, I a thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because
thou hast b hid these things from
the wise and c prudent, and hast d revealed them unto e babes.
26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed

me of my Father: and no man
knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither b knoweth any man the Father,

Chapter 12
Jesus proclaims Himself Lord of the
Sabbath and heals on the Sabbath
day—He is accused of casting out devils
through the power of Beelzebub—He
speaks of blasphemy against the Holy
Ghost and says that an evil and adul- terous generation seeks signs.
At that time Jesus went on the a sabbath day through the b corn; and
his disciples were an hungred, and
began to pluck the c ears of corn,
and to eat.
2 But when the Pharisees saw it,
they said unto him, Behold, thy dis- ciples do that which is not lawful
to do upon the sabbath day.
3 But he said unto them, Have ye
not a read what b David did, when
he was an hungred, and they that
were with him;
4 How he entered into the house
of God, and did eat the a shewbread,
which was not lawful for him to eat,
neither for them which were with
him, but only for the priests?
5 Or have ye not read in the law,
how that on the a sabbath days the
priests in the temple profane the
sabbath, and are blameless?
6 But I say unto you, That in this
place is one greater than the a temple.
7 But if ye had known what this
meaneth, I will have a mercy, and
not sacrifice, ye would not have
condemned the guiltless.
8 For the Son of man is Lord even
of the a sabbath day.
9 And when he was departed
thence, he went into their synagogue:
10 ¶ And, behold, there was a man
which had his hand withered. And
they asked him, saying, Is it lawful
to heal on the sabbath days? that
they might accuse him.

that shall have one sheep, and if it
fall into a pit on the sabbath day,
will he not lay hold on it, and lift
it out?
12 How much then is a man better
than a sheep? Wherefore it is law- ful to do well on the sabbath days.
13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch
forth thine hand. And he stretched
it forth; and it was restored whole,
like as the other.
14 ¶ Then the Pharisees went out,
and held a council against him, how
they might destroy him.
15 But a when Jesus knew it, he
withdrew himself from thence: and
great multitudes followed him, and
he healed them all;
16 And charged them that they
should not make him known:
17 That it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by a Esaias the prophet,
saying,
18 Behold my a servant, whom I
have b chosen; my c beloved, in whom
my soul is well pleased: I will put
my spirit upon him, and he shall
shew judgment to the Gentiles.
19 He shall not strive, nor a cry; neither shall any man hear his voice
in the streets.
20 A bruised reed shall he not
break, and smoking flax shall he
not quench, till he send forth a judg- ment unto victory.
21 And in his a name shall the b Gentiles trust.
22 ¶ Then was brought unto him
one possessed with a devil, blind,
and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
both spake and saw.
23 And all the people were amazed,
and said, Is not this the son of a David?
24 But when the Pharisees heard
it, they said, This fellow doth not
cast out devils, but by a Beelzebub
the prince of the devils.
25 And Jesus knew their a thoughts,
and said unto them, Every b kingdom
divided against itself is brought
to desolation; and every city or
house divided against itself shall
not stand:
26 And if a Satan cast out Satan, he
is divided against himself; how shall
then his kingdom stand?
27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out
devils, by whom do your children
cast them out? therefore they shall
be your judges.
28 But if I cast out a devils by the b Spirit of God, then the kingdom of
God is come unto c you.
29 Or else how can one enter into
a strong man’s house, and a spoil
his goods, except he first bind the
strong man? and then he will spoil
his house.
30 He that is not with me is against
me; and he that gathereth not a with
me scattereth abroad.
31 ¶ Wherefore I say unto you,
All manner of sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven a unto men: but
the b blasphemy against the Holy
Ghost shall c not be forgiven unto
men.
32 And whosoever speaketh a word
against the Son of man, it shall
be forgiven him: but whosoever
speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it
shall not be a forgiven him, neither

tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt:
for the tree is known by his b fruit.
34 O a generation of vipers, how can
ye, being evil, b speak good things?
for out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh.
35 A good man out of the good a treasure of the heart bringeth forth
good things: and an evil man out
of the evil treasure bringeth forth
b evil things.
36 But I say unto you, That every a idle b word that men shall c speak,
they shall give d account thereof in

37 For by thy a words thou shalt
be justified, and by thy words thou
shalt be condemned.
38 ¶ Then certain of the scribes
and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a a sign
from thee.
39 But he answered and said
unto them, An evil and adulterous
generation seeketh after a a sign;
and there shall no sign be given
to it, but the sign of the prophet
Jonas:
40 For as Jonas was three days and
three nights in the whale’s belly;
so shall the Son of man be a three
days and three nights in the heart
of the earth.
41 The men of a Nineveh shall rise
in judgment with this generation,
and shall condemn it: because they
b repented at the preaching of Jonas;
and, behold, a greater than Jonas
is here.
42 The a queen of the south shall
rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it: for
she came from the uttermost parts
of the earth to hear the wisdom of
Solomon; and, behold, a greater than
Solomon is here.
43 a When the b unclean spirit is
gone out of a man, he walketh
through dry places, seeking rest,
and findeth none.
44 Then he saith, I will return into
my house from whence I came out;
and when he is come, he findeth it
empty, swept, and garnished.
45 Then goeth a he, and taketh with
himself seven other b spirits more
wicked than himself, and they en- ter in and dwell there: and the last
c state of that man is d worse than the
first. Even so shall it be also unto
this wicked generation.
46 ¶ While he yet talked to the
people, behold, his mother and his a brethren stood b without, desiring
to speak with him.
47 Then one said unto him, Behold,
thy mother and thy brethren stand
without, desiring to speak with thee.
48 But he answered and said
unto him that told him, Who is my
mother? and who are my brethren?
49 And he stretched forth his hand
toward his disciples, and said, Behold my a mother and my brethren!
50 For whosoever shall do the a will
of my Father which is in heaven,
the same is my b brother, and sister,
and mother.

Chapter 13
Jesus explains why He teaches with
parables—He gives the parables of
the sower, the wheat and the tares, the
grain of mustard seed, the leaven, the
treasure hidden in the field, the pearl
of great price, and the net cast into the
sea—A prophet is not honored by his
own people.
The same day went Jesus out of the
house, and sat by the a sea side.
2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he
went into a ship, and sat; and the
whole multitude stood on the shore.
3 And he spake many things unto
them in parables, saying, Behold, a
sower went forth to sow;
4 And when he sowed, some seeds
fell by the way side, and the fowls
came and devoured them up:
5 Some fell upon a stony places,
where they had not much earth: and
forthwith they sprung up, because
they had no deepness of earth:
6 And when the sun was up, they
were scorched; and because they
had no root, they withered away.
7 And some fell among a thorns;
and the thorns sprung up, and
choked them:
8 But other fell into good ground,
and a brought forth fruit, some an
hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some
thirtyfold.
9 Who hath ears to hear, let him
hear.
10 And the disciples came, and
said unto him, Why speakest thou
unto them in a parables?
11 He answered and said unto
them, Because it is given unto you
to know the a mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is
not given.
12 a For whosoever hath, to him
shall be b given, and he shall have
more c abundance: but whosoever
hath not, from him shall be taken
away even that he hath.
13 Therefore speak I to them in
parables: because they seeing see
not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
14 And in them is fulfilled the
prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
hearing ye shall a hear, and shall not
understand; and seeing ye shall see,
and shall not perceive:
15 For this people’s a heart is waxed
gross, and their ears are dull of
hearing, and their b eyes they have c closed; lest at any time they should
see with their eyes, and hear with
their ears, and should understand
with their heart, and should be converted, and I should d heal them.
16 But blessed are your a eyes, for
they see: and your ears, for they hear.
17 For verily I say unto you, That
many a prophets and righteous men
have desired to see those things which
ye see, and have not seen them; and
to hear those things which ye hear,
and have not heard them.
18 ¶ a Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
19 When any one heareth the word
of the kingdom, and a understandeth
it not, then cometh the wicked one,
and b catcheth away that which was
sown in his heart. This is he which
received seed by the way side.

20 But he that received the seed
into a stony places, the same is he
that heareth the word, and anon
with joy receiveth it;
21 Yet hath he not root in himself,
but dureth for a while: for when
a tribulation or b persecution ariseth
because of the word, by and by c he
is offended.
22 He also that received seed
among the thorns is he that heareth
the word; and the care of this a world,
and the b deceitfulness of c riches,
choke the word, and he becometh
unfruitful.
23 But he that received seed into
the good ground is he that a heareth
the word, and b understandeth
it; which also beareth c fruit, and
bringeth forth, some an hundred- fold, some sixty, some thirty.
24 ¶ Another a parable put he forth
unto them, saying, The b kingdom of
heaven is likened unto a man which
sowed good c seed in his field:
25 But while men slept, his enemy
came and sowed a tares among the
wheat, and went his way.
26 But when the blade was sprung
up, and brought forth fruit, then
appeared the tares also.
27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,
Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in
thy field? from whence then hath
it tares?
28 He said unto them, An enemy
hath done this. The servants said
unto him, Wilt thou then that we
go and gather them up?
29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye
gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them.
30 Let both grow together until
the a harvest: and in the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers,
Gather ye together b first the tares,
and bind them in bundles to c burn
them: but gather the wheat into
my barn.
31 ¶ Another parable put he forth
unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven is like to a a grain of mustard
seed, which a man took, and sowed
in his field:
32 Which indeed is the least of
all seeds: but when it is grown, it
is the greatest among herbs, and
becometh a tree, so that the a birds
of the air come and lodge in the
branches thereof.
33 ¶ Another parable spake he
unto them; The kingdom of heaven
is like unto a leaven, which a woman
took, and hid in three measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened.
34 All these things spake Jesus
unto the multitude in parables;
and without a parable spake he not
unto them:
35 That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophet,
saying, I will open my mouth in
a parables; I will utter things which
have been kept b secret from the
foundation of the world.
36 Then Jesus sent the multitude
away, and went into the house: and
his disciples came unto him, saying,
Declare unto us the parable of the
a tares of the field.
37 He answered and said unto
them, He that soweth the good a seed
is the Son of man;
38 The field is the world; the good
seed are the children of the kingdom;

but the a tares are the children of

of the world; and the reapers are
the angels.
40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall
it be in the a end of this world.
41 The Son of man shall send forth
his a angels, and they shall gather out
of his kingdom all things that b offend, and them which do iniquity;
42 And shall cast them into a fur- nace of fire: there shall be a wailing
and b gnashing of teeth.
43 Then shall the a righteous b shine
forth as the c sun in the kingdom of
their Father. Who hath ears to hear,

44 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven
is like unto a treasure hid in a field;
the which when a man hath found,
he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and
buyeth that field.
45 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven
is like unto a merchant man, seek- ing goodly pearls:
46 Who, when he had found one a pearl of great price, went and sold
b all that he had, and bought it.
47 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven
is like unto a net, that was cast into
the sea, and a gathered of every kind:
48 Which, when it was full, they
drew to shore, and sat down, and
gathered the good into vessels, but
cast the bad away.
49 So shall it be at the a end of the b world: the angels shall come forth,
and c sever the wicked from among
the d just,
50 a And shall cast them into the
furnace of fire: there shall be wail- ing and gnashing of teeth.
51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye
understood all these things? They
say unto him, Yea, Lord.
52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every a scribe b which is instructed
unto the kingdom of heaven is like
unto a man that is an householder,
which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
53 ¶ And it came to pass, that when
Jesus had finished these parables,
he departed thence.
54 And when he was come into
his own country, he taught them
in their synagogue, insomuch that
they were a astonished, and said,
Whence hath this man this b wisdom,
and these mighty works?
55 Is not this the carpenter’s a son?
is not his mother called Mary ? and
his b brethren, James, and Joses, and
Simon, and Judas?
56 And his sisters, are they not all
with us? Whence then hath this man
all these things?
57 And they were offended in him.
But Jesus said unto them, A prophet
is not without a honour, save in his
own country, and in his own house.
58 And he did not many mighty
works there because of their a un- belief.

Chapter 14
John the Baptist is beheaded—Jesus
feeds the five thousand and walks on
the sea—Those who touch the hem of
His garment are made whole.
At that time a Herod the tetrarch
heard of the fame of Jesus,
2 And said unto his servants, This is
John the Baptist; he is risen from the
dead; and therefore mighty works
do shew forth themselves in him.
3 ¶ For Herod had laid hold on
John, and bound him, and put him
in prison for Herodias’ sake, his
brother Philip’s wife.
4 For John said unto him, It is not a lawful for thee to have her.
5 And a when he would have put
him to death, he feared the multi- tude, because they counted him as
a b prophet.
6 But when Herod’s birthday was
kept, the daughter of Herodias
danced before them, and pleased
Herod.
7 Whereupon he a promised with
an oath to give her whatsoever she
would ask.
8 And she, being before instructed
of her mother, said, Give me here
John Baptist’s head in a a charger.
9 And the king was sorry: nev- ertheless for the oath’s sake, and
them which sat with him at meat,
he commanded it to be given her.
10 And he sent, and a beheaded
John in the prison.
11 And his head was brought in
a charger, and given to the damsel:
and she brought it to her mother.
12 And his disciples came, and
took up the body, and buried it, and
went and told Jesus.
13 ¶ When Jesus heard of it, he de- parted thence by ship into a desert
place apart: and when the people
had heard thereof, they followed him
on foot out of the cities.
14 And Jesus went forth, and saw
a great multitude, and was moved
with a compassion toward them, and
he healed their b sick.
15 ¶ And when it was evening, his
disciples came to him, saying, This
is a desert place, and the time is now
past; send the multitude away, that
they may go into the villages, and
buy themselves a victuals.
16 But Jesus said unto them, They
need not depart; give ye them to eat.
17 And they say unto him, We have
here but five loaves, and two fishes.
18 He said, Bring them hither to me.
19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
took the five loaves, and the two
fishes, and looking up to heaven,
he blessed, and a brake, and gave
the loaves to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude.
20 And they did all eat, and were
filled: and they a took up of the
fragments that remained twelve
baskets full.
21 And they that had eaten were
about a five thousand men, beside
women and children.
22 ¶ And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
ship, and to go before him unto the
other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
23 And when he had sent the multi- tudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to a pray: and when the eve- ning was come, he was there alone.
24 But the ship was now in the
midst of the sea, tossed with waves:
for the wind was contrary.
25 And a in the fourth watch of the
night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
26 And when the disciples saw

him walking on the sea, they were
troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and
they cried out for fear.
27 But straightway Jesus spake
unto them, saying, Be of good a cheer;
it is I; be not afraid.
28 And Peter answered him and
said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come
unto thee on the water.
29 And he said, Come. And when
Peter was come down out of the
ship, he walked on the water, to go
to Jesus.
30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was a afraid; and beginning to
sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
31 And immediately Jesus stretched
forth his hand, and caught him, and
said unto him, O thou of little a faith,
wherefore didst thou b doubt?
32 And when they were come into
the ship, the wind ceased.
33 Then they that were in the ship
came and worshipped him, saying,
Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
34 ¶ And when they were gone
over, they came into the land of
Gennesaret.
35 And when the men of that place a had knowledge of him, they sent
out into all that country round
about, and brought unto him all
that were diseased;
36 And besought him that they
might only touch the a hem of his
garment: and as many as touched
were made perfectly b whole.
Chapter 15
The scribes and Pharisees contend against
Jesus—He heals the daughter of a gentile
woman—He feeds the four thousand.
Then came to Jesus a scribes and
Pharisees, which were of Jerusa- lem, saying,
2 Why do thy disciples transgress
the a tradition of the elders? for they
wash not their hands when they
eat bread.
3 But he answered and said unto
them, Why do ye also transgress the
commandment of God by your a tradition?
4 For God commanded, saying, a Honour thy father and mother: and,
He that curseth father or mother,
b let him die the death.
5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say
to his father or his mother, It is a a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest
be profited by me;
6 And honour not his father or his
mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye
made the commandment of God of
none effect by your tradition.
7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias
prophesy of you, saying,
8 This people draweth nigh unto
me with their a mouth, and b hon- oureth me with their lips; but their c heart is far from me.
9 But in vain they do a worship me,
teaching for b doctrines the c com- mandments of men.
10 ¶ And he called the multitude,
and said unto them, Hear, and un- derstand:
11 Not that which goeth into the
mouth a defileth a man; but that
which cometh out of the b mouth,
this defileth a man.
12 Then came his disciples, and
said unto him, Knowest thou that
the Pharisees were offended, after
they heard this saying?
13 But he answered and said,

into the ditch.
15 Then answered Peter and
said unto him, Declare unto us this
parable.
16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet
without understanding?
17 Do not ye yet understand, that
whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
goeth into the belly, and is cast out
into the draught?
18 But those things which proceed
out of the a mouth come forth from
the heart; and they defile the man.
19 For out of the a heart proceed
evil thoughts, b murders, c adulteries, d fornications, thefts, e false witness,
f blasphemies:
20 These are the things which a defile
a man: but to eat with unwashen
hands defileth not a man.
21 ¶ Then Jesus went thence, and
departed into the a coasts of Tyre
and Sidon.
22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
and cried unto him, saying, Have
mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of
David; my daughter is grievously
vexed with a devil.
23 But he answered her not a word.
And his disciples came and besought
him, saying, Send her away; for she
crieth after us.
24 But he answered and said, I am
not a sent but unto the lost sheep of
the house of b Israel.
25 Then came she and worshipped
him, saying, Lord, help me.
26 But he answered and said, It
is not meet to take the children’s
bread, and to cast it to a dogs.
27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet
the dogs eat of the crumbs which
fall from their masters’ table.
28 Then Jesus answered and said
unto her, O woman, great is thy a faith: be it unto thee even as thou
wilt. And her daughter was made
whole from that very hour.
29 And Jesus departed from thence,
and came nigh unto the sea of Gali- lee; and went up into a mountain,
and sat down there.
30 And great multitudes came unto
him, having with them those that
were lame, blind, dumb, maimed,
and many others, and cast them
down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed
them:
31 Insomuch that the multitude
wondered, when they saw the dumb
to speak, the maimed to be whole,
the lame to walk, and the blind to
see: and they glorified the God of
Israel.
32 ¶ Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because
they continue with me now three
days, and have nothing to eat: and
I will not send them away fasting,
lest they faint in the way.
33 And his disciples say unto him,
Whence should we have so much
bread in the wilderness, as to fill
so great a multitude?
34 And Jesus saith unto them, How
many loaves have ye? And they said,
Seven, and a few little fishes.
35 And he commanded the mul- titude to sit down on the ground.
36 And he took the seven a loaves
and the fishes, and gave thanks,
and brake them, and gave to his
disciples, and the disciples to the
multitude.

the coasts of Magdala.
Chapter 16
Jesus warns against the doctrine of
the Pharisees and Sadducees—Peter
testifies that Jesus is the Christ and is
promised the keys of the kingdom—Jesus
foretells His death and resurrection.
The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
him that he would shew them a
sign from a heaven.
2 He a answered and said unto them,
When it is evening, ye say, It will be
fair weather: for the sky is red.
3 And in the morning, It will be
foul weather to day: for the sky is
red and a lowring. O ye b hypocrites,
ye can discern the face of the sky;
but can ye not discern the c signs of
the d times?
4 A wicked and a adulterous generation seeketh after a b sign; and there
shall no sign be given unto it, but
the c sign of the prophet d Jonas. And
he left them, and departed.
5 And when his disciples were
come to the other side, they had
forgotten to take bread.
6 ¶ Then Jesus said unto them,
Take heed and beware of the a leaven
of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
taken no bread.
8 a Which when Jesus perceived,
he said unto them, O ye of little
faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no
bread?
9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of
the five thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up?
10 Neither the seven loaves of the
four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
concerning bread, that ye should
beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
12 Then understood they how that
he bade them not beware of the
leaven of bread, but of the a doctrine of the Pharisees and of the
b Sadducees.
13 ¶ When Jesus came into the
coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked
his disciples, saying, Whom do men
say that I the Son of man am?
14 And they said, Some say that thou
art John the Baptist: some, a Elias;
and others, Jeremias, or one of the
prophets.
15 He saith unto them, But whom
say a ye that I am?
16 And Simon Peter answered and
said, Thou art the a Christ, the b Son
of the c living God.
17 And Jesus answered and said
unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
a Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath
not b revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven.

thou art Peter, and upon this a rock I
will build my b church; and the gates
of c hell shall not d prevail against it.
19 And I will a give unto thee the b keys of the c kingdom of heaven:
and whatsoever thou shalt d bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven:
and whatsoever thou shalt loose
on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
20 Then charged he his disciples
that they should tell no man that
he was Jesus the a Christ.
21 ¶ From that time forth began
Jesus to shew unto his disciples,
how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the
elders and chief priests and scribes,
and be killed, and be a raised again
the third day.
22 Then Peter took him, and began
to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from
thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
23 But he turned, and said unto
Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
thou art an offence unto me: for
thou a savourest not the things that
be of God, but those that be of men.
24 ¶ a Then said Jesus unto his dis- ciples, If any man will come after
me, let him bdeny himself, and take
up his c
cross, and d follow e
me.
25 For whosoever will save his life
shall lose it: and whosoever will a lose
his life for my sake shall b find it.
26 For what is a man a profited, if
he shall b gain the whole c world, and d lose his own e soul? or what shall a
man give in exchange for his soul?
27 For the a Son of man shall come
in the b glory of his Father with
his angels; and then he shall c reward every man according to his
d works.
28 Verily I say unto you, There be
some standing here, which shall not
taste of a death, till they see the Son
of man coming in his b kingdom.
Chapter 17
Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James,
and John on the mount—Jesus heals a
lunatic, tells of His coming death, and
pays taxes in a miraculous manner.
And after six days Jesus taketh a Peter, James, and John his brother,
and bringeth them up into an high
mountain apart,
2 And was a transfigured before
them: and his face did shine as the
sun, and his raiment was white as
the light.

3 And, behold, there appeared
unto them a Moses and b Elias talking with him.
4 Then answered Peter, and said
unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us
to be here: if thou wilt, let us make
here three tabernacles; one for thee,
and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
5 While he yet spake, behold, a
bright a cloud overshadowed them:
and behold a b voice out of the cloud,
which said, This is my c beloved d Son, in whom I am well pleased;
hear ye him.
6 And when the disciples heard
it, they fell on their face, and were
sore a afraid.
7 And Jesus came and touched
them, and said, Arise, and be not
afraid.
8 And when they had lifted up
their eyes, they saw no man, save
Jesus only.
9 And as they came down from
the mountain, Jesus charged them,
saying, Tell the a vision to no b man,
until the Son of man be risen again
from the c dead.
10 And his disciples asked him,
saying, Why then say the scribes
that Elias must first come?
11 a And Jesus answered and said
unto them, Elias truly shall first
come, and b restore all things.
12 But I say unto you, That Elias is
come already, and they knew him
not, but have done unto him what- soever they a listed. Likewise shall
also the Son of man suffer of them.
13 Then the disciples understood
that he spake unto them of John
the Baptist.
14 ¶ And when they were come to
the multitude, there came to him a
certain man, kneeling down to him,
and saying,
15 Lord, have mercy on my son:
for he is lunatic, and sore vexed:
for ofttimes he a falleth into the fire,
and oft into the water.
16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
17 Then Jesus answered and said,
O a faithless and b perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?
how long shall I suffer you? bring
him hither to me.
18 And Jesus rebuked the devil;
and he departed out of him: and the
child was cured from that very hour.
19 Then came the disciples to Jesus
apart, and said, Why could not we
cast him out?
20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your a unbelief: for verily
I say unto you, If ye have b faith as
a grain of mustard seed, ye shall
say unto this c mountain, Remove
hence to yonder place; and it shall
remove; and nothing shall be d impossible unto you.
21 Howbeit this a kind goeth not
out but by prayer and b fasting.
22 ¶ And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
of man shall be a betrayed into the
hands of men:
23 And they shall kill him, and the
third day he shall be a raised again.
And they were exceeding sorry.
24 ¶ And when they were come to
Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said,
Doth not your master pay a tribute?

come into the house, Jesus a prevented him, saying, What thinkest
thou, Simon? of whom do the b kings
of the earth take custom or trib- ute? of their own children, or of
strangers?
26 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are
the children free.
27 Notwithstanding, lest we should
offend them, go thou to the sea, and
cast an hook, and take up the fish
that first cometh up; and when thou
hast opened his mouth, thou shalt

and b give unto them for me and thee.
Chapter 18
Jesus explains how we are to treat our
offending brethren—The Son of Man
came to save that which was lost—
All of the Twelve receive the keys of
the kingdom—Jesus explains why we
should forgive.
At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the
a greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
2 And Jesus called a little child
unto him, and set him in the midst
of them,
3 And said, Verily I say unto you,
Except ye be converted, and become
as little a children, ye shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven.
4 Whosoever therefore shall a hum- ble himself as this little b child, the
same is greatest in the kingdom of
heaven.
5 And whoso shall receive one
such little child in my a name re- ceiveth me.
6 But whoso shall a offend one of
these little ones which believe in
me, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his
neck, and that he were drowned in
the depth of the sea.
7 ¶ Woe unto the world because
of a offences! for it must needs be
that offences come; but woe to that
man by whom the offence cometh!
8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot
offend thee, cut them off, and cast
them from thee: it is better for thee
to enter into life halt or maimed,
rather than having two hands or
two feet to be cast into everlasting
fire.
9 And if thine eye offend thee,
pluck it out, and cast it from thee:
it is better for thee to enter into life
with one eye, rather than having
two eyes to be cast into a hell fire.
10 Take heed that ye despise not
one of these a little ones; for I say
unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of
my Father which is in heaven.
11 For the a Son of man is come to b save that which was c lost.
12 How think ye? if a man have an
hundred a sheep, and one of them be
gone astray, doth he not leave the
ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountains, and seeketh that which
is gone astray ?
13 And if so be that he find it, ver- ily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more
of that sheep, than of the ninety and
nine which went not astray.
14 Even so it is not the will of
your Father which is in heaven,
that one of these a little ones should b perish.

him his c fault between thee and him
alone: if he shall hear thee, thou
hast gained thy brother.
16 But if he will not hear thee, then
take with thee one or two more,
that in the mouth of two or three
a witnesses every word may be established.
17 And if he shall neglect to hear
them, tell it unto the a church: but
if he b neglect to hear the c church,
let him be unto thee as an heathen
man and a publican.
18 Verily I say unto you, Whatso- ever ye shall a bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven.
19 Again I say unto you, That if
two of you shall a agree on earth as b touching any thing that they shall
c ask, it shall be done for them of my
Father which is in heaven.
20 For where two or three are a gath- ered b together in my c name, there
am I in the d midst of them.
21 ¶ Then came Peter to him, and
said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
sin against me, and I a forgive him?
till seven times?
22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but,
Until a seventy times seven.
23 ¶ Therefore is the kingdom of
heaven likened unto a certain king,
which would a take account of his b servants.
24 And when he had begun to
reckon, one was brought unto him,
which owed him ten thousand
talents.
25 But forasmuch as he had not to
pay, his lord commanded him to be
a sold, and his wife, and children,
and all that he had, and payment
to be made.
26 The servant therefore fell down,
and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
have patience with me, and I will
pay thee all.
27 Then the lord of that servant
was moved with compassion, and
loosed him, and forgave him the
debt.
28 But the same servant went out,
and found one of his fellowservants,
which owed him a an hundred pence:
and he laid hands on him, and took
him by the throat, saying, Pay me
that thou owest.
29 And his fellowservant fell down
at his feet, and besought him, say- ing, Have patience with me, and I
will pay thee all.
30 And he would not: but went and
cast him into prison, till he should
pay the debt.
31 So when his fellowservants
saw what was done, they were very
a sorry, and came and told unto their
lord all that was done.
32 Then his lord, after that he had
called him, said unto him, O thou
wicked servant, I forgave thee all
that a debt, because thou desiredst
me:
33 a Shouldest not thou also have
had b compassion on thy fellowser- vant, even as I had c pity on thee?
34 And his lord was wroth, and
delivered him to the tormentors,
till he should pay all that was due
unto him.

Father do also unto you, if ye from

Chapter 19
Jesus teaches about marriage and divorce—Eternal life is for those who
keep the commandments—The Twelve
Apostles will judge the house of Israel.
And it came to pass, that when
Jesus had finished these sayings,
he departed from Galilee, and came
into the coasts of Judæa beyond
Jordan;
2 And great multitudes followed
him; and he healed them there.
3 ¶ The Pharisees also came unto
him, tempting him, and saying
unto him, Is it lawful for a man to
a put away his wife for every cause?
4 And he answered and said unto
them, Have ye not read, that he
which a made them at the beginning
made them male and female,
5 And said, For this cause shall a
man leave father and mother, and
shall a cleave to his wife: and they
twain shall be one flesh?
6 Wherefore they are no more
twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath a joined together, let
not man b put asunder.
7 They say unto him, Why did
Moses then command to give a
a writing of b divorcement, and to
put her away ?
8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the a hardness of your hearts
suffered you to put away your b wives:
but from the beginning it was not so.
9 And I say unto you, Whosoever
shall put away his wife, except it
be for a fornication, and shall marry
another, committeth b adultery: and
whoso marrieth her which is put
away doth commit adultery.
10 ¶ His disciples say unto him, If
the case of the man be so with his
wife, it is not good to marry.
11 But he said unto them, All men
cannot receive this saying, save they
to whom it is given.
12 For there are some eunuchs,
which were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of
men: and there be eunuchs, which
have made themselves eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He
that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.
13 ¶ Then were there brought unto
him little children, that he should
put his a hands on them, and pray:
and the disciples rebuked b them.
14 But Jesus said, a Suffer little b children, and forbid them not, to
come unto me: for of such is the
kingdom of heaven.
15 And he laid his hands on them,
and departed thence.
16 ¶ And, behold, one came and
said unto him, Good Master, what
good thing shall I do, that I may
have a eternal life?
17 And he said unto him, Why
callest thou me good? there is none a good but one, that is, God: but if
thou wilt enter into b life, keep the c commandments.
18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus

Thou shalt not commit b adultery,
Thou shalt not c steal, Thou shalt

mother: and, Thou shalt b love thy c neighbour as thyself.
20 The young man saith unto him,
All these things have I kept from my
youth up: what lack I yet?
21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt
be a perfect, go and sell that thou
hast, and b give to the c poor, and thou
shalt have d treasure in heaven: and
come and e follow me.
22 But when the young man heard
that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had a great possessions.
23 ¶ Then said Jesus unto his dis- ciples, Verily I say unto you, That a
a rich man shall b hardly enter into
the kingdom of heaven.
24 And again I say unto you, It
is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle, than for a a rich
man to enter into the kingdom
of God.
25 When his disciples heard it, they
were exceedingly amazed, saying,
Who then can be saved?
26 a But Jesus beheld them, and
said unto them, With men this is
impossible; but with God all things
are b possible.
27 ¶ Then answered Peter and said
unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
all, and followed thee; what shall
we have therefore?
28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily
I say unto you, That ye which have
followed me, in the a regeneration
when the Son of man shall sit in the
throne of his glory, ye also shall sit
upon twelve thrones, b judging the
twelve tribes of Israel.
29 And every one that hath a forsaken houses, or brethren, or sis- ters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for my b name’s
sake, shall receive an hundredfold,
and shall inherit c everlasting life.
30 But many that are a first shall be
last; and the last shall be first.
Chapter 20
Jesus gives the parable of the laborers
in the vineyard—He foretells His crucifixion and resurrection—He came
to give His life as a ransom for many.
For the kingdom of heaven is like
unto a man that is an householder,
which went out early in the morning
to hire a labourers into his vineyard.
2 And when he had agreed with
the labourers for a penny a day, he
sent them into his a vineyard.
3 And he went out about the third
hour, and saw others standing a idle
in the marketplace,
4 And said unto them; Go ye also
into the vineyard, and whatsoever
is right I will give you. And they
went their way.
5 Again he went out about the sixth
and ninth hour, and did likewise.
6 And about the a eleventh hour he
went out, and found others stand- ing idle, and saith unto them, Why
stand ye here all the day idle?
7 They say unto him, Because no
man hath hired us. He saith unto
them, Go ye also into the vineyard;
and whatsoever is right, that shall
ye receive.

of the vineyard saith unto his
steward, Call the a labourers, and
give them their b hire, beginning
from the last unto the first.
9 And when they came that were
hired about the eleventh hour, they
received every man a penny.
10 But when the first came, they
supposed that they should have
received more; and they likewise
received every man a penny.
11 And when they had received it,
they murmured against the goodman of the house,
12 Saying, These last have wrought
but one hour, and thou hast made
them equal unto us, which have
borne the burden and heat of the
day.
13 But he answered one of them,
and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong:
didst not thou agree with me for a
penny ?
14 Take that thine is, and go thy
way: I will give unto this last, even
as unto thee.
15 Is it not lawful for me to do what
I will with mine own? Is thine eye
evil, because I am good?
16 So the a last shall be first, and
the first last: for many be b called,
but few chosen.
17 ¶ And Jesus going up to Jerusa- lem took the twelve disciples apart
in the way, and said unto them,
18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;
and the Son of man shall be a be- trayed unto the chief priests and
unto the scribes, and they shall
condemn him to b death,
19 And shall deliver him to the
Gentiles to a mock, and to scourge,
and to b crucify him: and the third
day he shall c rise again.
20 ¶ Then came to him the mother
of Zebedee’s children with her sons,
worshipping him, and desiring a
certain thing of him.
21 And he said unto her, What wilt
thou? She saith unto him, Grant that
these my two sons may sit, the one
on thy right hand, and the other on
the left, in thy kingdom.
22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye
know not what ye ask. Are ye able
to drink of the cup that I shall drink
of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They
say unto him, We are able.
23 And he saith unto them, Ye
shall drink indeed of my cup, and
be baptized with the baptism that
I am baptized with: but to sit on
my right hand, and on my left, is
not mine to give, but it shall be given
to them for whom it is prepared of
my a Father.
24 And when the ten heard it,
they were moved with indignation
against the two brethren.
25 But Jesus called them unto him,
and said, Ye know that the princes
of the Gentiles exercise dominion
over them, and they that are great
exercise authority upon them.
26 But it shall not be so among you:
but whosoever will be a great among
you, let him be your b minister;
27 And whosoever a will be chief
among you, let him be your b servant:
28 Even as the a Son of man came
not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to b give his life a c ran- som for many.
29 And as they departed from
Jericho, a great multitude followed
him.

out, saying, Have mercy on us, O

31 And the multitude rebuked
them, because they should hold
their peace: but they cried the more,
saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord,
thou Son of David.
32 And Jesus stood still, and called
them, and said, What will ye that I
shall do unto you?

Chapter 21
Jesus rides in triumph into Jerusalem—
He cleanses the temple, curses the fig
tree, and discusses authority—He gives
the parables of the two sons and the
wicked husbandmen.
And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Beth- phage, unto the mount of Olives,
then sent Jesus two disciples,
2 Saying unto them, Go into the village a over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a
colt with her: loose them, and bring
them unto me.
3 And if any man say ought unto
you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
need of them; and straightway he
will send them.
4 All this was done, that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet, saying,
5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy a King cometh unto thee,
meek, and sitting upon an ass, and
a colt the foal of an ass.
6 And the disciples went, and did
as Jesus commanded them,
7 a And brought the ass, and the
colt, and put on them their clothes,
and they set him thereon.
8 And a very great multitude
spread their garments in the way;
others cut down branches from the
trees, and strawed them in the way.
9 And the multitudes that went
before, and that followed, cried,
saying, a Hosanna to the Son of
David: b Blessed is he that cometh
in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in
the highest.
10 And when he was come into
Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
saying, Who is this?
11 And the a multitude said, This
is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of
Galilee.
12 ¶ And Jesus went into the temple
of God, and cast out all them that
sold and bought in the temple, and
overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that
sold doves,
13 And said unto them, It is written, My a house shall be called the
house of b prayer; but ye have made
it a c den of thieves.
14 And the blind and the lame
came to him in the temple; and he
healed them.
15 And when the chief priests and
scribes saw the wonderful things
that he did, and the a children crying
in the temple, and saying, Hosanna
to the Son of David; they were sore
displeased,
16 And said unto him, Hearest thou
what these say ? And Jesus saith unto
them, Yea; have ye never read, Out
of the mouth of babes and sucklings
thou hast perfected praise?
17 ¶ And he left them, and went
out of the city into Bethany; and
he lodged there.
18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

19 And when he saw a fig tree a in
the way, he came to it, and found
nothing thereon, but leaves only,
and said unto it, Let no b fruit grow
on thee henceforward for ever. And
c presently the fig tree withered
away.
20 And when the disciples saw it,
they marvelled, saying, How soon
is the fig tree withered away!
21 Jesus answered and said unto
them, Verily I say unto you, If ye
have a faith, and b doubt not, ye shall
not only do this which is done to the
fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto
this c mountain, Be thou removed,
and be thou cast into the sea; it
shall be done.
22 And all a things, whatsoever ye
shall b ask in c prayer, believing,
ye shall receive.
23 ¶ And when he was come into
the temple, the chief priests and the
elders of the people came unto him
as he was teaching, and said, By
what a authority doest thou these
things? and who gave thee this
authority ?
24 And Jesus answered and said
unto them, I also will ask you one
thing, which if ye tell me, I in like
wise will tell you by what a authority I do these things.
25 The baptism of John, whence
was it? from heaven, or of men? And
they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven;
he will say unto us, Why did ye not
then believe him?
26 But if we shall say, Of men; we
fear the people; for all hold John
as a a prophet.
27 And they answered Jesus, and
said, We cannot tell. And he said
unto them, Neither tell I you by
what authority I do these things.
28 ¶ But what think ye? A certain
man had two sons; and he came to
the first, and said, Son, go a work to
day in my vineyard.
29 He answered and said, a I will
not: but afterward he repented,
and went.
30 And he came to the second, and
said likewise. And he answered
and said, I go, sir: and a went b not.
31 Whether of them twain did the
will of his father? They say unto
him, The first. Jesus saith unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the
kingdom of God before you.
32 For John came unto you in the
way of a righteousness, and ye b be- lieved him not: but the c publicans
and the harlots believed him: d and
ye, when ye had seen it, repented
not afterward, that ye might believe him.
33 ¶ a Hear another parable: There
was a certain householder, which
planted a vineyard, and hedged it
round about, and digged a winepress
in it, and built a tower, and let it
out to b husbandmen, and went into
a far country:
34 And when the time of the fruit
drew near, he sent his servants to
the husbandmen, that they might
receive the fruits of it.

35 And the husbandmen took his a servants, and b beat one, and killed
another, and stoned another.
36 Again, he sent other servants
more than the first: and they did
unto them likewise.
37 But last of all he sent unto them
his son, saying, They will reverence
my son.
38 But when the husbandmen saw
the son, they said among themselves,
This is the a heir; come, let us kill him,
and let us seize on his inheritance.
39 And they caught him, and cast
him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
40 When the lord therefore of the
vineyard cometh, what will he do
unto those husbandmen?
41 They say unto him, He will
miserably destroy those wicked
men, and will let out his a vineyard
unto other husbandmen, which
shall render him the fruits in their
seasons.
42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye
never read in the scriptures, The
a stone which the builders b rejected,
the same is become the head of the
c corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and
it is marvellous in our eyes?
43 Therefore say I unto you, The a kingdom of God shall be b taken
from you, and c given to a d nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof.
44 a And whosoever shall fall on
this stone shall be broken: but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind
him to powder.
45 a And when the chief priests and
Pharisees had heard his parables,
they perceived that he spake of
them.
46 But when they sought to lay
hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a
prophet.
Chapter 22
Jesus gives the parable of the marriage
of the king’s son—Pay tribute to Cæsar
and to God—Worldly marriages endure
in this life only—The first command- ment is to love the Lord—Jesus asks,
What think ye of Christ?
And Jesus answered and spake unto
them again by parables, and said,
2 The kingdom of heaven is like
unto a certain king, which a made
a b marriage for his son,
3 And sent forth his servants to
call them that were bidden to the
wedding: and a they would not come.
4 Again, he sent forth other ser- vants, saying, Tell them which are
bidden, Behold, I have prepared my
dinner: my oxen and my fatlings
are killed, and all things are ready:
come unto the marriage.
5 But they made light of it, and
went their ways, one to his farm,
another to his merchandise:
6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully,
and slew them.
7 But when the king heard thereof,
he was wroth: and he sent forth his
armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
8 Then saith he to his servants, The
wedding is ready, but they which
were bidden were not worthy.
9 Go ye therefore into the high- ways, and as many as ye shall find,
bid to the marriage.
10 So those servants went out into
the highways, and a gathered together all as many as they found,

both bad and good: and the wedding
was furnished with guests.
11 ¶ And when the king came in
to see the guests, he saw there a
man which had not on a wedding
a garment:
12 And he saith unto him, Friend,
how camest thou in hither not hav- ing a wedding garment? And he was
speechless.
13 Then said the king to the ser- vants, Bind him hand and foot,
and take him away, and cast him
into a outer darkness; there shall
be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
14 For many are a called, but few
are b chosen.
15 ¶ Then went the Pharisees, and
took counsel how they might a en- tangle him in his talk.
16 And they sent out unto him
their disciples with the Herodians,
saying, Master, we know that thou
art true, and teachest the way of
God in truth, a neither carest thou
for any man: for thou b regardest not
the person of men.
17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest
thou? Is it a lawful to give tribute
unto Cæsar, or not?
18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why a tempt ye me,
ye hypocrites?
19 Shew me the tribute money.
And they brought unto him a penny.
20 And he saith unto them, Whose
is this image and superscription?
21 They say unto him, Cæsar’s.
Then saith he unto them, a Render
therefore unto b Cæsar the things
which are Cæsar’s; and unto God
the things that are God’s.
22 When they had heard these
words, they marvelled, and left him,
and went their way.
23 ¶ The same day came to him
the a Sadducees, which say that there
is no resurrection, and asked him,
24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If
a man die, having no children, his
a brother shall b marry his wife, and
raise up seed unto his brother.
25 Now there were with us seven
brethren: and the first, when he
had married a wife, deceased, and,
having no issue, left his wife unto
his brother:
26 Likewise the second also, and
the third, unto the seventh.
27 And last of all the woman died
also.
28 Therefore in the resurrection
whose wife shall she be of the seven?
for they all had her.
29 Jesus answered and said unto
them, Ye do err, not knowing the
a scriptures, nor the b power of God.
30 For in the a resurrection they
neither b marry, nor are given in
marriage, but are as the c angels of
God in heaven.
31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by
God, saying,
32 I am the a God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of Ja- cob? God is not the God of the dead,
but of the living.
33 And when the multitude heard
this, they were astonished at his
doctrine.

b heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy c mind.
38 This is the first and great a commandment.
39 And the second is like unto it,

thyself.

hang all the a law and the prophets.

gathered together, Jesus asked them,
42 Saying, What think ye of Christ?
whose son is he? They say unto him,
The Son of a David.
43 He saith unto them, How then
doth David in spirit call him Lord,
saying,
44 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit
thou on my right hand, till I make
thine enemies thy footstool?
45 If David then call him Lord,
how is he his son?

him a word, neither a durst any man
from that day forth ask him any
more questions.
Chapter 23
Jesus pronounces woes upon the scribes
and Pharisees—They will be held responsible for killing the prophets—
They will not escape the damnation
of hell.
Then spake Jesus to the multitude,
and to his disciples,
2 Saying, The a scribes and the
Pharisees sit in Moses’ b seat:
3 All therefore whatsoever they
bid you observe, that observe and
do; but do not ye after their works:
for they say, and do not.
4 For they bind heavy burdens
and grievous to be borne, and lay
them on men’s shoulders; but they
themselves will not move them with
one of their fingers.
5 But all their works they do for to
be seen of men: they a make broad
their b phylacteries, and enlarge the c borders of their garments,
6 And love the a uppermost rooms
at feasts, and the chief seats in the
synagogues,
7 And greetings in the markets, and
to be called of men, Rabbi, a Rabbi.
8 But be not ye called a Rabbi: for
one is your b Master, even Christ; and
all ye are brethren.
9 a And call no man your father
upon the earth: for one is your
Father, which is in heaven.
10 Neither be ye called masters:
for one is your Master, a even Christ.
11 But he that is a greatest among
you shall be your b servant.

that shall c humble himself shall

13 ¶ But woe unto you, a scribes and b Pharisees, c hypocrites! for ye shut
up the kingdom of heaven against
men: for ye neither go in yourselves,
neither suffer ye them that are en- tering to go in.
14 Woe unto you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye a devour
widows’ houses, and for a pretence
make long prayer: therefore ye shall
receive the greater b damnation.
15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea
and land to make one proselyte,
and when he is made, ye make him
twofold more the child of hell a than
yourselves.
16 Woe unto you, ye a blind guides,
which say, Whosoever shall swear
by the temple, it is nothing; but
whosoever shall swear by the gold
of the temple, he is a debtor!
17 Ye fools and blind: for whether
is greater, the gold, or the temple
that sanctifieth the gold?
18 And, Whosoever shall swear
by the altar, it is nothing; but who- soever sweareth by the gift that is
upon it, he is guilty.
19 Ye fools and blind: for whether
is greater, the gift, or the altar that
sanctifieth the gift?
20 Whoso therefore shall swear by
the altar, sweareth by it, and by all
things thereon.
21 And whoso shall swear by the
temple, sweareth by it, and by him
that dwelleth therein.
22 And he that shall swear by
heaven, sweareth by the throne of
God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, a hypocrites! for ye pay b tithe of
mint and c anise and cummin, and
have d omitted the weightier matters
of the law, e judgment, f mercy, and
faith: these ought ye to have done,
and not to leave the other undone.
24 Ye blind guides, which strain at
a gnat, and swallow a a camel.
25 Woe unto you, scribes and Phari- sees, hypocrites! for ye make clean
the outside of the cup and of the
platter, but within they are full of
a extortion and b excess.
26 Thou blind Pharisee, a cleanse
first that which is within the cup
and platter, that the outside of them
may be clean also.
27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto
a whited b sepulchres, which indeed
appear c beautiful outward, but are
within full of dead men’s bones, and
of all d uncleanness.
28 Even so ye also outwardly appear a righteous unto men, but within ye
are full of b hypocrisy and iniquity.
29 Woe unto you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
build the tombs of the prophets,
and garnish the sepulchres of the

you a prophets, and wise men, and b scribes: and some of them ye shall
kill and crucify; and some of them
shall ye scourge in your synagogues,
and persecute them from city to city:
35 That upon you may come all
the righteous a blood shed upon the
earth, from the blood of b righteous

Chapter 24
Jesus foretells the doom of Jerusalem
and the destruction of the temple—
Great calamities will precede His Second Coming—He gives the parable of
the fig tree.
And Jesus went out, and departed
from the temple: and his disciples
came to him for to a shew him the
buildings of the b temple.
2 And Jesus said unto them, a See
ye not all these things? verily I say
unto you, There shall not be left
here one b stone upon another, that
shall not be thrown down.
3 ¶ And as he sat upon the mount
of Olives, the disciples came unto
him privately, saying, Tell us, when
shall these things be? and what shall
be the a sign of thy coming, and of
the end of the b world?
4 And Jesus answered and said
unto them, Take heed that no man
a deceive you.
5 For many shall come in my a name, saying, I am b Christ; and
shall c deceive many.
6 And ye shall hear of a wars and
rumours of wars: see that ye be not
b troubled: for all these things must
come to pass, but the end is not yet.
7 For a nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against king- dom: and there shall be b famines,
and pestilences, and earthquakes,
in divers places.
8 All these are the beginning of a sorrows.

9 Then shall they deliver you up
to be afflicted, and shall a kill you:
and ye shall be b hated of all nations c for my name’s sake.
10 And then shall many be a offended, and shall betray one an- other, and shall hate one another.
11 And many a false prophets shall
rise, and shall deceive many.
12 And because a iniquity shall
abound, the love of many shall
wax b cold.
13 But he that shall a endure unto
the end, the same shall be saved.
14 And this a gospel of the b kingdom
shall be preached in all the world
for a witness unto all nations; and
then shall the c end come.
15 When ye therefore shall see the a abomination of desolation, spoken
of by Daniel the prophet, stand in
the b holy place, (whoso readeth, let
him c understand:)
16 Then let them which be in
Judæa a flee into the mountains:
17 Let him which is on the house- top not come down to take any thing
out of his house:
18 Neither let him which is in the
field return back to take his clothes.
19 And a woe unto them that are
with child, and to them that give
suck in those days!
20 But pray ye that your flight be
not in the winter, neither on the
sabbath day:
21 For then shall be great a tribulation, such as was not since the
beginning of the world to this time,
no, nor ever shall be.
22 And except those days should be
shortened, there should no flesh be
saved: but for the elect’s sake those
a days shall be shortened.
23 Then if any man shall say unto
you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; a believe it not.
24 For there shall arise a false b Christs, and c false prophets, and
shall shew great d signs and wonders;
insomuch that, if it were possible,
they shall e deceive the very f elect.
25 Behold, I have told you before.
26 Wherefore if they shall say unto
you, Behold, he is in the desert; go
not forth: behold, he is in the a secret
chambers; believe it not.
27 For as the a lightning cometh out
of the b east, and shineth even unto

of the Son of man be.

be c darkened, and the moon shall
not give her light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven, and the powers of

of the Son of man in b heaven: and

31 And he shall send his a angels
with a great sound of a b trumpet,
and they shall gather together his
c elect from the four winds, from one
end of d heaven to the other.
32 Now learn a parable of the a fig
tree; When his branch is yet tender,
and putteth forth leaves, ye know
that summer is nigh:
33 So likewise ye, when ye shall
see all these things, know that a it
is near, even at the b doors.
34 Verily I say unto you, This a generation shall not pass, till all these
b things be c fulfilled.
35 Heaven and earth shall a pass
away, but my b words shall not c pass away.
36 ¶ But of that a day and b hour
knoweth no man, no, not the c angels of heaven, but my Father only.
37 But as the days of a Noe were,
so shall also the coming of the Son
of man be.
38 For as in the days that were
before the a flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving
in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark,
39 And knew not until the flood
came, and took them all away; so
shall also the coming of the Son of
man be.
40 Then shall two be in the field;
the one shall be taken, and the
other left.
41 Two women shall be grinding at
the mill; the one shall be taken, and
the other left.
42 ¶ a Watch therefore: for ye know
not what hour your Lord doth
come.
43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
what watch the thief would come,
he would have watched, and would
not have suffered his house to be
a broken up.
44 Therefore be ye also a ready: for
in such an b hour c as ye think not
the Son of man cometh.
45 Who then is a a faithful and b wise c servant, whom his lord hath made
ruler over his household, to give
them meat in due season?
46 Blessed is that a servant, whom
his lord when he cometh shall find
so doing.
47 Verily I say unto you, That he
shall make him ruler over all his
goods.
48 But and if that evil servant shall
say in his heart, My lord a delayeth
his coming;
49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink
with the drunken;
50 The lord of that servant shall
come in a day when he looketh not
for him, and in an hour that he is
not aware of,
51 And shall cut him asunder, and
appoint him his portion with the
hypocrites: there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.

a Then shall the kingdom of heaven
be likened unto ten b virgins, which
took their c lamps, and went forth to
meet the bridegroom.
2 And five of them were wise, and
five were foolish.
3 They that were foolish took their
lamps, and took no oil with them:
4 But the wise took oil in their
vessels with their lamps.
5 While the bridegroom tarried,
they all a slumbered and b slept.
6 And at midnight there was a
cry made, Behold, the a bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet him.
7 Then all those virgins arose, and
trimmed their a lamps.
8 And the foolish said unto the
wise, Give us of your oil; for our
lamps a are gone out.
9 But the wise answered, saying,
Not so; lest there be not enough for
us and you: but go ye rather to them
that sell, and buy for yourselves.
10 And while they went to buy,
the bridegroom came; and they
that were a ready went in with him
to the marriage: and the door was
b shut.
11 Afterward came also the other
virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open
to us.
12 But he answered and said, a Ver- ily I say unto you, I b know you not.
13 a Watch therefore, for ye know
neither the day nor the hour wherein
the Son of man cometh.
14 ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is as
a man travelling into a far country,
who called his own servants, and
delivered unto them his goods.
15 And unto one he a gave five b talents, to another two, and to another
one; to every man according to his
several ability; and straightway took
his journey.
16 Then he that had received the
five talents went and traded with
the same, and made them other five
talents.
17 And likewise he that had received
two, he also gained other two.
18 But he that had received one
went and digged in the earth, and
hid his lord’s money.
19 After a long time the lord of
those servants cometh, and a reckoneth with them.
20 And so he that had received
five talents came and brought
other five talents, saying, Lord, thou
a deliveredst unto me five talents:
behold, I have gained beside them
five talents more.
21 His lord said unto him, Well
done, thou good and faithful a servant: thou hast been b faithful over
a few things, I will make thee c ruler
over many things: enter thou into
the d joy of thy lord.
22 He also that had received two
talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents:
behold, I have gained two other
talents beside them.
23 His lord said unto him, Well
done, good and a faithful servant;
thou hast been faithful over a few
things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the
joy of thy lord.
24 Then he which had received
the one talent came and said, Lord,
I knew thee that thou art an a hard
man, reaping where thou hast not
sown, and gathering where thou
hast not strawed:

hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there
thou hast that is thine.
26 His lord answered and said unto
him, Thou wicked and a slothful
servant, thou knewest that I b reap
where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strawed:
27 Thou oughtest therefore to have
put my money to the exchangers,
and then at my coming I should have
received mine own with a usury.
28 Take therefore the a talent from
him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents.
29 For unto every one that hath
shall be a given, and he shall have b abundance: but from him that hath
not shall be c taken away even that
which he hath.
30 And cast ye the unprofitable
servant into outer darkness: there
shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.
31 ¶ When the a Son of man shall
come in his b glory, and all the holy
angels with him, then shall he sit
upon the throne of his glory:
32 And before him shall be gathered all a nations: and he shall b separate them one from another,
as a c shepherd divideth his d sheep
from the goats:
33 And he shall set the sheep on
his a right hand, but the goats on
the left.
34 Then shall the King say unto
them on his a right hand, Come, ye b blessed of my Father, c inherit the d kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world:
35 For I was an a hungred, and ye b gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me drink: I was a c stranger,
and ye took me in:
36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I
was sick, and ye a visited me: I was
in b prison, and ye came unto me.
37 Then shall the righteous answer
him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty,
and gave thee drink?
38 When saw we thee a stranger,
and took thee in? or naked, and
clothed thee?
39 Or when saw we thee a sick, or
in prison, and came unto thee?
40 And the King shall answer and
say unto them, Verily I say unto
you, Inasmuch as ye have a done it
unto one of the b least of these my c brethren, ye have done it unto me.
41 Then shall he say also unto
them on the a left hand, b Depart
from me, ye c cursed, into everlast- ing d fire, e prepared for the devil
and his angels:
42 For I was an a hungred, and ye
gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me no drink:
43 I was a stranger, and ye took
me not in: naked, and ye clothed
me not: sick, and in prison, and ye
visited me not.
44 Then shall they also answer him,
saying, Lord, when saw we thee an
hungred, or athirst, or a stranger,
or naked, or sick, or in prison, and
did not minister unto thee?

Chapter 26
Jesus is anointed—He keeps the Passover and institutes the sacrament—He
suffers in Gethsemane, is betrayed by
Judas, and is taken before Caiaphas—
Peter denies that he knows Jesus.
And it came to pass, when Jesus had
finished all these sayings, he said
unto his disciples,
2 Ye know that after two days
is the feast of the a passover, and
the Son of man is b betrayed to be c crucified.
3 Then assembled together the
chief priests, and the scribes, and
the elders of the people, unto the
palace of the high priest, who was
called a Caiaphas,
4 And a consulted that they might
take Jesus by b subtilty, and c kill
him.
5 But they said, Not on the feast
day, lest there be an a uproar among
the people.
6 ¶ Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
7 There came unto him a woman
having an alabaster box of very pre- cious a ointment, and poured it on
his head, as he sat at meat.
8 But when his disciples saw it,
they had indignation, saying, To
what purpose is this a waste?
9 For this ointment might have
been sold for much, and given to
the poor.
10 When Jesus understood it, he
said unto them, Why trouble ye
the woman? for she hath a wrought
a good work upon me.
11 For ye have the poor always
with you; but me ye have not always.
12 For in that she hath poured
this ointment on my body, she did
it a for my burial.
13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
in the whole world, there shall also
this, that this woman hath done, be
told for a memorial of her.
14 ¶ Then one of the twelve, called
Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief
priests,
15 And said unto them, What will
ye give me, and I will deliver him
unto you? And they covenanted
with him for a thirty pieces of silver.
16 And from that time he sought
opportunity to a betray him.
17 ¶ Now the first day of the feast
of a unleavened bread the disciples
came to Jesus, saying unto him,
Where wilt thou that we prepare
for thee to eat the b passover?
18 And he said, Go into the city a to
such a man, and say unto him, The
Master saith, My b time is at hand; I

19 And the disciples did as Jesus
had appointed them; and they made
ready the a passover.
20 Now when the even was come,
he sat down with the twelve.
21 And as they did eat, he said,
Verily I say unto you, that one of
you shall betray me.
22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

betrayed! c it had been good for that
man if he had not been d born.
25 Then Judas, which betrayed
him, answered and said, Master, is it
I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
26 ¶ a And as they were eating,
Jesus took b bread, c
and blessed
it, and brake it, and gave it to the
disciples, and said, Take, eat; this
is my d body.
27 And he took the a cup, and gave
thanks, and gave it to them, saying, b Drink ye all of it;
28 For this is my a blood of the new b testament, which is shed for many
for the c remission of sins.
29 But I say unto you, I will not a drink henceforth of this fruit of the
vine, until that day when I b drink
it new with you in my Father’s
kingdom.
30 And when they had sung an a hymn, they went out into the mount
of Olives.
31 Then saith Jesus unto them,
All ye shall be a offended because
of me this night: for it is written, I
will b smite the c shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered
abroad.
32 But after I am a risen again, I will
go before you into Galilee.
33 Peter answered and said unto
him, Though all men shall be of- fended because of thee, yet will I
never be a offended.
34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I
say unto thee, That this night, be- fore the cock crow, thou shalt deny
me thrice.
35 Peter said unto him, Though I
should die with thee, yet will I not
deny thee. Likewise also said all
the disciples.
36 ¶ Then cometh Jesus with
them unto a place called a Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples,
Sit ye here, while I go and b pray
yonder.
37 And he took with him Peter
and the two sons of Zebedee, and
a began to be sorrowful and very

unto death: tarry ye here, and b watch

and fell on his face, and a prayed,
saying, O my b Father, if it be pos- sible, let this c cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I d will, but as e thou f wilt.

saith unto Peter, What, b could ye not
watch with me one hour?
41 a Watch and b pray, that ye enter
not into c temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O
my Father, if this cup may not pass
away from me, except I drink it, thy
a will be done.
43 And he came and found them
asleep again: for their eyes were
heavy.
44 And he left them, and went
away again, and prayed the third
time, saying the same words.
45 Then cometh he to his disciples,
and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
and take your rest: behold, the hour
is at hand, and the Son of man is
a betrayed into the hands of sinners.
46 Rise, let us be going: behold,
he is at hand that doth betray me.
47 ¶ And while he yet spake, lo,
Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
with him a great multitude with
swords and staves, from the chief
priests and elders of the people.
48 Now he that betrayed him gave
them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
I shall kiss, that same is he: hold
him fast.
49 And a forthwith he came to
Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
kissed him.
50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend,
wherefore art thou come? Then
came they, and laid hands on Jesus,
and took him.
51 And, behold, one of them which
were with Jesus stretched out his
hand, and drew his sword, and
struck a a servant of the high priest’s,
and smote off his ear.
52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put
up again thy sword into his place:
for all they that take the sword shall
a perish with the sword.
53 Thinkest thou that I cannot
now pray to my Father, and he shall
presently give me more than twelve
legions of angels?
54 But how then shall the a scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must
be?
55 In that same hour said Jesus to
the multitudes, Are ye come out
as against a thief with swords and
staves for to take me? I sat daily
with you a teaching in the temple,
and ye laid no hold on me.
56 But all this was done, that the
scriptures of the prophets might
be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
forsook him, and fled.
57 ¶ And they that had laid hold
on Jesus led him away to a Caiaphas
the high priest, where the scribes
and the elders were assembled.
58 But Peter followed him afar off
unto the high priest’s palace, and
went in, and sat with the servants,
to see the end.
59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
false a witness against Jesus, b to put
him to death;
60 But found none: yea, though
many false witnesses came, yet
found they none. At the last came
two false a witnesses,
61 And said, This fellow said, I am
able to destroy the a temple of God,
and to build it in three days.
62 And the high priest arose, and
said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness
against thee?
63 But Jesus a held his b peace.
And the high priest answered and

said: nevertheless I say unto you,

man sitting on the right hand of
b power, and c coming in the clouds

65 Then the high priest rent his

and said, He is a guilty b of c death.

palace: and a a damsel came unto
him, saying, Thou also wast with

70 But he denied before them all,
saying, I know not what thou sayest.
71 And when he was gone out into
the porch, another maid saw him,
and said unto them that were there,
This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth.
72 And again he denied with an
oath, I do not know the man.
73 And after a while came unto him
they that stood by, and said to Peter,
Surely thou also art one of them; for
thy speech a bewrayeth thee.
74 Then began he to curse and to
swear, saying, I know not the man.
And immediately the a cock crew.
75 And Peter remembered the
word of Jesus, which said unto him,

and wept bitterly.
Chapter 27
Jesus is accused and condemned before
Pilate—Barabbas is released—Jesus is
mocked, crucified, and buried in the
tomb of Joseph of Arimathæa.
When the morning was come, all
the chief priests and elders of the
people took counsel against Jesus
to put him to death:
2 And when they had bound him,
they led him away, and delivered
him to a Pontius Pilate the governor.
3 ¶ Then Judas, which had be- trayed him, when he saw that he
was condemned, repented himself,
and brought again the thirty pieces
of silver to the chief priests and
elders,
4 Saying, I have sinned in that I
have a betrayed the innocent b blood.
And they said, What is that to us? c see thou to that.
5 And he cast down the pieces of
silver in the temple, and departed,
and went a and b hanged himself.
6 And the chief priests took the sil- ver pieces, and said, It is not lawful
for to put them into the treasury,
because it is the price of blood.
7 And they took counsel, and
bought with them the a potter’s field,
to bury b strangers in.
8 Wherefore that field was called,
The field of blood, unto this day.

saying, And they took the a thirty
pieces of silver, the price of him
that was valued, whom they of the
children of Israel did value;
10 And gave them for the potter’s
field, as the Lord appointed me.
11 And Jesus stood before the
governor: and the governor asked
him, saying, Art thou the King of
the Jews? And Jesus said unto him,
a Thou sayest.
12 And when he was accused of
the chief priests and elders, he answered a nothing.
13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hear- est thou not how many things they
witness against thee?
14 And he answered him to never
a word; insomuch that the governor
marvelled greatly.
15 Now at that feast the governor
was a wont to b release unto the people a prisoner, whom they c would.
16 And they had then a notable
prisoner, called Barabbas.
17 Therefore when they were
gathered together, Pilate said unto
them, Whom will ye that I release
unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which
is called Christ?
18 For he knew that for a envy they
had b delivered him.
19 ¶ When he was set down on the
judgment seat, his wife sent unto
him, saying, Have thou nothing to
do with that just man: for I have
suffered many things this day in a
a dream because of him.
20 But the chief a priests and el- ders b persuaded the multitude that
they should c ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
21 The governor answered and said
unto them, Whether of the twain
will ye that I release unto you? They
said, Barabbas.
22 Pilate saith unto them, What
shall I do then with Jesus which is
called Christ? They all say unto him,
Let him be a crucified.
23 And the governor said, Why,
what evil hath he done? But they
cried out a the more, saying, Let him
be crucified.
24 ¶ When Pilate saw that he a could
prevail nothing, but that rather a b tumult was made, he took water,
and washed his hands before the
multitude, saying, I am innocent
of the blood of this c just person:
see ye to it.
25 Then answered all the people,
and said, His a blood be on us, and
on our children.
26 ¶ Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had
a scourged Jesus, he delivered him
to be crucified.
27 Then the soldiers of the governor
took Jesus into the a common hall,
and gathered unto him the whole
band of soldiers.
28 And they stripped him, and put
on him a a scarlet robe.
29 ¶ And when they had a plaited
a crown of thorns, they put it upon
his head, and a b reed in his right
hand: and they bowed the knee be- fore him, and mocked him, saying,
Hail, King of the Jews!
30 And they a spit upon him, and
took the reed, and smote him on
the head.
31 And after that they had mocked
him, they took the robe off from him,
and put his own raiment on him,
and led him away to crucify him.

found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
name: him they compelled to bear
his cross.
33 And when they were come unto
a place called Golgotha, that is to
say, a place of a a skull,
34 ¶ They gave him a vinegar to
drink mingled with gall: and when
he had tasted thereof, he would not
drink.
35 And they a crucified him, and b parted his garments, casting lots:
that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophet, They parted
my c garments among them, and
upon my vesture did they cast lots.
36 And sitting down they watched
him there;
37 And set up over his head his
accusation written, This Is Jesus
the King of the Jews. 38 Then were there two thieves
crucified with him, one on the right
hand, and another on the left.
39 ¶ And they that passed by a reviled him, wagging their heads,
40 And saying, Thou that destroy- est the a temple, and buildest it in
three days, save thyself. If thou be
the b Son of God, come down from
the cross.
41 Likewise also the chief priests
mocking him, with the scribes and
elders, said,
42 He saved others; himself he can- not save. If he be the King of Israel,
let him now come down from the
cross, and we will believe him.
43 He a trusted in God; let him b deliver him now, if he will have him:
for he said, I am the c Son of God.
44 The thieves also, which were
crucified with him, a cast the same
in his teeth.
45 Now from the sixth hour there
was a darkness over all the land unto
the ninth hour.
46 And about the ninth hour Jesus
cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli,
Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say,
a My God, my God, why hast thou
b forsaken me?
47 Some of them that stood there,
when they heard that, said, This man
calleth for a Elias.
48 And straightway one of them
ran, and took a sponge, and filled it
with a vinegar, and put it on a reed,
and gave him to drink.
49 The rest said, Let be, let us see
whether Elias will come to save him.
50 ¶ Jesus, when he had cried
again with a a loud voice, yielded
up the ghost.
51 And, behold, the a veil of the
temple was b rent in twain from the
top to the bottom; and the earth did
c quake, and the rocks rent;
52 And the a graves were opened;
and many b bodies of the c saints d which slept e arose,
53 And came out of the graves after
his resurrection, and went into the
a holy city, and appeared unto many.
54 Now when the centurion, and
they that were with him, watching
Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those
things that were done, they feared
greatly, saying, Truly this was the
Son of God.

Jesus from Galilee, ministering
unto him:
56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of
James and a Joses, and the mother
of Zebedee’s children.
57 When the even was come, there
came a rich man of Arimathæa,
named a Joseph, who also himself
was Jesus’ b disciple:
58 He went to Pilate, and a begged
the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
59 And when Joseph had taken
the body, he wrapped it in a clean
linen cloth,
60 And laid it in his own new tomb,
which he had hewn out in the rock:
and he rolled a great a stone to the
door of the b sepulchre, and departed.
61 And there was Mary Magdalene,
and the other Mary, sitting a over
against the sepulchre.
62 ¶ Now the next day, that fol- lowed the day of the a preparation,
the chief priests and Pharisees came
together unto Pilate,
63 Saying, Sir, we remember that
that a deceiver said, while he was
yet alive, After three days I will
rise again.
64 Command therefore that the
sepulchre be made sure until the
third day, lest his disciples come by
night, and steal him away, and say
unto the people, He is risen from
the dead: so the last a error shall be
worse than the first.
65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have
a watch: go your way, make it as
sure as ye can.
66 So they went, and made the
sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
and setting a watch.
Chapter 28
Christ the Lord is risen—He appears
to many—He has all power in heaven
and earth—He sends the Apostles to
teach and baptize all nations.
a In the end of the b sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of
the week, came Mary Magdalene and
the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
2 And, behold, there was a great
earthquake: for a the b angel of the
Lord descended from heaven, and
came and rolled back the stone from
the door, and sat upon it.
3 a His b countenance was like light- ning, and his raiment white as snow:
4 And for fear of him the keepers
did shake, and became as dead men.
5 a And the angel answered and
said unto the women, Fear not ye:
for I know that ye seek Jesus, which
was crucified.
6 He is not here: for he is a risen, as
he said. Come, see the place where
the b Lord lay.
7 And go quickly, and tell his
disciples that he is risen from the
dead; and, behold, he goeth before
you into Galilee; there shall ye see
him: lo, I have told you.
8 And they departed quickly from
the sepulchre with fear and great
joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
9 ¶ And as they went to tell his
disciples, behold, a Jesus met them,
saying, All hail. And they came
and held him by the feet, and wor- shipped him.
10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be
not afraid: go tell my brethren that
they go into Galilee, and there shall
they see me.

11 ¶ Now when they were going,
behold, some of the a watch came into
the city, and b shewed unto the chief
priests all the things that were done.
12 And when they were assembled
with the elders, and had taken coun- sel, they gave a  large money unto
the soldiers,
13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples
came by night, and stole him away
while we slept.
14 And if this come to the gover- nor’s ears, we will persuade him,
and a secure you.
15 So they took the money, and did
as they were taught: and this saying
is commonly reported among the
Jews until this day.
16 ¶ Then the eleven disciples went
away into Galilee, into a moun- tain where Jesus had appointed
them.
17 And when they saw him, they
worshipped him: but some a doubted.
18 And a  Jesus came and spake
unto them, saying, All b  power is
given unto me in heaven and in
earth.
19 ¶ Go ye therefore, and a teach
all b nations, c baptizing them in the
name of the d Father, and of the Son,

you alway, even unto the e end of the

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO
ST MARK
CHAPTER 1
Jesus is baptized by John—He preaches
the gospel, calls disciples, casts out
devils, heals the sick, and cleanses a
leper.
THE beginning of the a gospel
of Jesus Christ, the Son of
God;
2 As it is written in the prophets,
Behold, I send my a messenger before thy face, which shall prepare
thy way before thee.
3 The a voice of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the Lord, make his paths straight.
4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and a preach the b baptism of 
Mark 1:5–25 1242
c repentance for the d remission of
sins.
5 And there went out unto him
all the land of Judæa, and they of
Jerusalem, and were all a baptized
of him in the river of Jordan, b confessing their sins.
6 And John was a clothed with b camel’s hair, and with a girdle of
a skin about his loins; and he did
eat c locusts and wild honey;
7 And preached, saying, There
cometh one mightier than I after me,
the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to stoop down and unloose.
8 I indeed have baptized you
with water: a but he shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost.
9 And it came to pass in those days,
that Jesus came from Nazareth of
Galilee, and was a baptized of John
in Jordan.
10 And straightway coming a up
out of the water, he saw the heavens
opened, and the Spirit like a b dove
descending upon him:
11 And there came a voice from
heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.
12 a And immediately the Spirit
driveth him into the b wilderness.
13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;
and was with the wild beasts; and
the angels ministered unto him.
14 Now after that John was put
in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
a preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
15 And saying, The a time is fulfilled, and the b kingdom of God c is
at hand: d repent ye, and e believe
the gospel.
16 Now as he walked by the sea of
Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
his brother casting a net into the
sea: for they were fishers.
17 And Jesus said unto them, Come
ye after me, and I will make you to
become a fishers of men.
18 And straightway they forsook
their nets, and followed him.
19 And when he had gone a little
further thence, he saw James the son
of Zebedee, and John his brother,
who also were in the ship mending
their nets.
20 And straightway he called them:
and they left their father Zebedee
in the ship with the hired servants,
and went after him.
21 And they went into Capernaum;
and straightway on the sabbath day
he entered into the synagogue, and
a taught.
22 And they were astonished at
his doctrine: for he taught them as
one that had a authority, and not as
the b scribes.
23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an a unclean spirit;
and he cried out,
24 Saying, Let us alone; a what have
we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
Nazareth? art thou come to destroy
us? I know thee who thou art, the
b Holy One of God.
25 And Jesus a rebuked him, saying,
Hold thy peace, and come out of
him.

26 And when the unclean spirit
had a torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him.
27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
themselves, saying, What thing is this?
what new doctrine is this? for with a authority commandeth he even the
unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
28 And immediately his fame
spread abroad throughout all the
region round about Galilee.
29 And forthwith, when they were
come out of the synagogue, they
entered into the house of Simon
and Andrew, with James and John.
30 But Simon’s wife’s mother lay
sick of a fever, and a anon they tell
him of her.
31 And he came and took her by
the hand, and a lifted her up; and
immediately the fever left her, and
she ministered unto them.
32 And at even, when the sun did
set, they brought unto him all that
were diseased, and them that were
possessed with devils.
33 And all the city was gathered
together at the door.
34 And he a healed many that were
sick of divers diseases, and cast out
many b devils; and c suffered not the
devils to speak, because they knew
him.
35 And in the morning, rising up
a great while before day, he went
out, and departed into a solitary
place, and there prayed.
36 And Simon and they that were
with him followed after him.
37 And when they had found him,
they said unto him, All men seek for
thee.
38 And he said unto them, Let us
go into the next towns, that I may
a preach there also: for therefore
came I forth.
39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and
cast out a devils.
40 And there came a a leper to him,
beseeching him, and kneeling down
to him, and saying unto him, If thou
wilt, thou canst make me b clean.
41 And Jesus, moved with a compassion, put forth his hand, and
touched him, and saith unto him,
I will; be thou clean.
42 And as soon as he had spoken,
immediately the leprosy departed
from him, and he was cleansed.
43 And he a straitly charged him,
and forthwith sent him away;
44 And saith unto him, See thou
say nothing to any man: but go thy
way, shew thyself to the priest, and
offer for thy cleansing those things
which Moses commanded, for a tes- timony unto them.
45 But he went out, and began
to publish it much, and to a blaze
abroad the matter, insomuch that
Jesus could no more openly enter
into the city, but was without in
desert places: and they came to him
from every quarter.
Chapter 2
Jesus forgives sins, heals a paralytic,
eats with tax gatherers and sinners,
and announces that He is Lord of the
Sabbath.
And again he entered into Caper- naum after some days; and it was
noised that he was a in the house.
2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there
was no room to receive them, no,
not so much as about the door: and
he a preached the word unto them.
3 And they come unto him, bring- ing one sick of the palsy, which was
a borne of four.

4 And when they could not come
nigh unto him for the press, they
uncovered the roof where he was:
and when they had broken it up,
they let down the bed wherein the
sick of the palsy lay.
5 When Jesus saw their faith, he
said unto the sick of the palsy, Son,
thy sins be a forgiven thee.
6 But there were certain of the
scribes sitting there, and reasoning
in their hearts,
7 Why doth this man thus speak a blasphemies? who can forgive sins
but God only ?
8 And immediately when Jesus
perceived in his spirit that they so
reasoned within themselves, he said
unto them, Why reason ye these
things in your hearts?
9 Whether is it easier to say to the
sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven
thee; or to say, Arise, and take up
thy bed, and walk?
10 But that ye may know that the a Son of man hath power on earth
to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick
of the palsy,)
11 I say unto thee, a Arise, and take
up thy b bed, and go thy way into
thine house.
12 And immediately he arose, took
up the bed, and went forth before
them all; insomuch that they were
all amazed, and glorified God,
saying, We never saw it on this
fashion.
13 And he went forth again by the
sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
14 And as he passed by, he saw
Levi the son of Alphæus sitting at
the a receipt of custom, and said unto
him, Follow me. And he arose and
followed him.
15 And it came to pass, that, as
Jesus sat at meat in his house, many
publicans and sinners sat also to- gether with Jesus and his disciples:
for there were many, and they
followed him.
16 And when the scribes and
Pharisees saw him eat with a publicans and sinners, they said unto his
disciples, How is it that he eateth
and drinketh with publicans and
sinners?
17 When Jesus heard it, he saith
unto them, They that are a whole
have no need of the physician, but
they that are sick: I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.
18 And the disciples of John and
of the Pharisees used to a fast: and
they come and say unto him, Why
do the disciples of John and of the
Pharisees fast, but thy disciples
fast not?
19 And Jesus said unto them, Can
the children of the bridechamber fast, while the a bridegroom is
with them? as long as they have
the b bridegroom with them, they
cannot fast.
20 But the days will come, when
the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then shall they fast
in those days.
21 No man also seweth a piece of a new cloth on an old garment: else
the new piece that filled it up taketh
away from the old, and the rent is
made worse.
22 And no man putteth new
wine into old bottles: else the
new wine doth burst the bottles, and
the wine is spilled, and the bottles
will be marred: but new wine must
be put into new bottles.
23 And it came to pass, that he
went through the corn fields on
the sabbath day; and his disciples
began, as they went, a to pluck the
ears of corn.
24 And the Pharisees said unto him,
Behold, why do they on the sabbath
day that which is not lawful?

never read what David did, when
he had need, and was an hungred,
he, and they that were with him?
26 How he went into the house of
God in the days of Abiathar the high
priest, and did eat the shewbread,
which is not lawful to eat but for
the priests, and gave also to them
which were with him?
27 And he said unto them, The a sabbath was made for man, and
not man for the sabbath:
28 a Therefore the b Son of man is
Lord also of the sabbath.
Chapter 3
Jesus heals on the Sabbath day—He
chooses and ordains the Twelve Apos- tles—He asks, Can Satan cast out Satan?—Jesus speaks of blasphemy against
the Holy Ghost and identifies those who
believe as being members of His family.
And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there
which had a withered hand.
2 And they a watched him, whether
he would heal him on the sabbath
day; that they might accuse him.
3 And he saith unto the man which
had the withered hand, Stand forth.
4 And he saith unto them, Is it
lawful to do good on the a sabbath
days, or to do evil? to save life, or
to kill? But they b held their peace.
5 And when he had looked round
about on them with a anger, being
grieved for the b hardness of their
hearts, he saith unto the man,
Stretch forth thine hand. And he
stretched it out: and his hand was
restored whole as the other.
6 And the Pharisees went forth, and
straightway took a counsel with the
Herodians against him, how they
might destroy him.
7 But Jesus withdrew himself with
his disciples to the sea: and a great
multitude from Galilee followed
him, and from Judæa,
8 And from Jerusalem, and from
Idumæa, and from beyond Jordan;
and they about Tyre and Sidon, a
great multitude, when they had
heard what great things he did,
came unto him.
9 And he spake to his disciples,
that a small a ship should wait on
him because of the multitude, lest
they should throng him.
10 For he had healed many; insomuch that they a pressed upon him
for to touch him, as many as had
plagues.
11 And a unclean spirits, when they
saw him, fell down before him, and
cried, saying, Thou art the Son of
God.
12 And he straitly charged them
that they should not make him
known.
13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he a would: and they came unto him.
14 And he a ordained twelve, that
they should be with him, and that
he might send them forth to b preach,
15 And to have a power to heal b sicknesses, and to cast out c devils:
16 And Simon he surnamed Peter;
17 And James the son of Zebedee,
and John the brother of James; and
he surnamed them Boanerges, which
is, The sons of a thunder:

20 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not
so much as a eat bread.
21 And when his friends heard of
it, they went out to lay hold on him:
for they said, He is a beside himself.
22 ¶ And the scribes which came
down from Jerusalem said, He hath
Beelzebub, and by the prince of the
devils casteth he out devils.
23 And he called them unto him,
and said unto them in parables, How
can Satan cast out Satan?
24 And if a kingdom be divided
against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
25 And if a house be divided against
itself, that house cannot stand.
26 And if Satan rise up against
himself, and be divided, he cannot
stand, but hath an end.
27 No man can enter into a strong
man’s house, and spoil his goods,
except he will first bind the strong
man; and then he will spoil his
house.
28 a Verily I say unto you, All sins
shall be forgiven unto the sons of
men, and blasphemies b wherewith
soever they shall blaspheme:
29 But he that shall a blaspheme
against the Holy Ghost hath never
b forgiveness, but is in danger of
c eternal damnation:
30 Because they said, He hath an
unclean spirit.
31 ¶ There came then his a breth- ren and his mother, and, standing
b without, sent unto him, calling
him.
32 And the multitude sat about
him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
without seek for thee.
33 And he answered them, saying,
Who is my mother, or my brethren?
34 And he looked round about on
them which sat about him, and said,
Behold my mother and my brethren!
35 For whosoever shall do the a will
of God, the same is my brother, and
my sister, and mother.
Chapter 4
Jesus gives the parables of the sower, the
candle under a bushel, the seed growing secretly, and the mustard seed—He
stills the tempest.
And he began again to teach by the a sea side: and there was gathered
unto him a great multitude, so that
he entered into a ship, and sat in
the sea; and the whole multitude
was by the sea on the land.
2 And he taught them many things
by parables, and said unto them in
his a doctrine,
3 Hearken; Behold, there went out
a a sower to sow:
4 And it came to pass, as he sowed,
some fell by the way side, and the
fowls of the air came and devoured
it up.
5 And some fell on stony ground,
where it had not much earth; and
immediately it sprang up, because
it had no depth of earth:
6 But when the sun was up, it was
scorched; and because it had no root,
it withered away.
7 And some fell among thorns, and
the thorns grew up, and choked it,
and it yielded no fruit.
8 And other fell on good ground,
and did yield fruit that sprang up
and increased; and brought forth,
some thirty, and some sixty, and
some an hundred.

10 And when he was a alone, they
that were about him with the twelve
asked of him the parable.
11 And he said unto them, Unto you
it is given to know the a mystery of
the kingdom of God: but unto them
that are without, all these things are
done in b parables:
12 That seeing they may see, and
not a perceive; and hearing they may
hear, and not understand; lest at any
time they should be converted, and
their sins should be b forgiven them.
13 And he said unto them, Know
ye not this parable? and how then
will ye know all parables?
14 ¶ The sower soweth the word.
15 And these are they by the
way side, where the word is sown;
but when they have heard, a Satan
cometh immediately, and taketh
away the word that was sown in
their hearts.
16 And these are they likewise
which are sown on stony ground;
who, when they have heard the
word, immediately a receive it with
gladness;
17 And have no root in themselves,
and so endure but for a time: afterward, when a affliction or b persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.
18 And these are they which are
sown among thorns; such as hear
the word,
19 And the cares of this world, and
the deceitfulness of a riches, and the b lusts of other things entering in,
choke the word, and it becometh
unfruitful.
20 And these are they which are
sown on good ground; such as hear
the word, and receive it, and bring
forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some
sixty, and some an hundred.
21 ¶ And he said unto them, Is a a candle brought to be put under a
bushel, or under a bed? and not to
be set on a candlestick?
22 For there is nothing hid, which
shall not be manifested; neither
was any thing kept secret, but that
it should come abroad.
23 a If any man have ears to hear,
let him hear.
24 And he said unto them, Take
heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to
you: a and unto you that hear shall
more be b given.
25 a For he that hath, to him shall
be given: and he that hath not, from
him shall be b taken even that which
he hath.
26 ¶ And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
seed into the ground;
27 And should sleep, and rise night
and day, and the seed should spring
and a grow up, he knoweth not how.
28 For the earth bringeth forth a fruit of herself; first the blade,
then the ear, after that the full corn
in the ear.
29 But when the fruit is brought
forth, immediately he putteth in the
sickle, because the a harvest is come.
30 ¶ And he said, Whereunto shall
we liken the kingdom of God? or
with what comparison shall we
compare it?
31 It is like a grain of mustard
seed, which, when it is sown in the
earth, is less than all the seeds that
be in the earth:
32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than

33 And with many such parables
spake he the word unto them, as
they were a able to hear it.
34 But without a parable spake he
not unto them: and when they were
alone, he expounded all things to
his disciples.
35 And the same day, when the
even was come, he saith unto them,
Let us pass over unto the other side.
36 And when they had sent away
the multitude, they took him even
as he was in the ship. And there
were also with him other little
ships.
37 And there arose a great storm of
wind, and the waves beat into the
ship, so that it was now full.
38 And he was in the hinder part
of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and
they awake him, and say unto him,
Master, carest thou not that we
perish?
39 And he arose, and rebuked the
wind, and said unto the sea, a Peace,
be still. And the wind ceased, and
there was a great b calm.
40 And he said unto them, Why
are ye so a fearful? how is it that ye
have no b faith?
41 And they feared exceedingly,
and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the
wind and the sea obey him?
Chapter 5
Jesus casts out a legion of devils, who
then enter the swine—A woman is
healed by touching Jesus’ clothes—He
raises Jairus’s daughter from the dead.
And they came over unto the other
side of the sea, into the country of
the Gadarenes.
2 And when he was come out of
the ship, immediately there met
him out of the tombs a man with
an unclean spirit,
3 Who had his dwelling among the
tombs; and no man could bind him,
no, not with chains:
4 Because that he had been often
bound with fetters and chains, and
the chains had been a plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken
in pieces: neither b could any man
tame him.
5 And always, night and day, he
was in the mountains, and in the
tombs, crying, and cutting himself
with stones.
6 But when he saw Jesus afar off,
he ran and worshipped him,
7 And cried with a loud voice, and
said, What have I to do with thee,
Jesus, thou Son of the most high
God? I a adjure thee by God, that
thou torment me not.
8 For he said unto him, Come out
of the man, thou a unclean b spirit.
9 And he asked him, What is thy
name? And he answered, saying, My
name is Legion: for we are many.
10 And he besought him much that
he would not send them away out
of the country.
11 Now there was there nigh unto
the mountains a great herd of swine
feeding.
12 And all the devils besought him,
saying, Send us into the swine, that
we may enter into them.
13 And forthwith Jesus gave them
leave. And the unclean spirits went
out, and entered into the swine: and
the herd ran violently down a steep
place into the sea, (they were about
two thousand;) and were a choked
in the sea.
14 And they that fed the swine
fled, and told it in the city, and in
the country. And they went out to
see what it was that was done.

a devil, and had the legion, sitting,
and clothed, and in his right b mind:
and they were afraid.
16 And they that saw it told them
how it befell to him that was pos- sessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.
17 And they began to pray him to
depart out of their coasts.
18 And when he was come into the
ship, he that had been possessed
with the devil prayed him that he
might be with him.
19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not,
but saith unto him, Go home to thy
friends, and tell them how great
things the Lord hath done for thee,
and hath had a compassion on thee.
20 And he departed, and began
to a publish in Decapolis how great
things Jesus had done for him: and
all men did marvel.
21 And when Jesus was passed
over again by ship unto the other
side, much people gathered unto
him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
22 And, behold, there cometh one
of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him,
he fell at his feet,
23 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the
point of death: I pray thee, come and
lay thy a hands on her, that she may
be healed; and she shall live.
24 And Jesus went with him; and
much people followed him, and
thronged him.
25 And a certain woman, which
had an a issue of blood twelve years,
26 And had suffered many things
of many physicians, and had spent
all that she had, and was nothing
bettered, but rather grew worse,
27 When she had heard of Jesus,
came in the press behind, and
touched his a garment.
28 For she said, If I may touch but
his clothes, I shall be whole.
29 And straightway the fountain
of her blood was dried up; and she
felt in her body that she was healed
of that plague.
30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that a virtue had gone
out of him, turned him about in
the press, and said, Who touched
my clothes?
31 And his disciples said unto him,
Thou seest the multitude thronging
thee, and sayest thou, Who touched
me?
32 And he looked round about to
see her that had done this thing.
33 But the woman fearing and
trembling, knowing what was done
in her, came and fell down before
him, and told him all the truth.
34 And he said unto her, Daughter,
thy a faith hath made thee whole;
go in b peace, and be whole of thy
plague.
35 While he yet spake, there came
from the ruler of the synagogue’s
house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the
Master any further?
36 As soon as Jesus heard the word
that was spoken, he saith unto the
ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid,
only a believe.
37 And he suffered no man to fol- low him, save Peter, and James, and
John the brother of James.
38 And he cometh to the house
of the ruler of the synagogue, and
seeth the tumult, and them that
wept and wailed greatly.
39 And when he was come in, he
saith unto them, Why make ye this
a ado, and weep? the damsel is not
dead, but sleepeth.
40 And they a laughed him to scorn.
But when he had put them all out,
he taketh the father and the mother
of the damsel, and them that were
with him, and entereth in where
the damsel was lying.

42 And straightway the damsel a arose, and walked; for she was of
the age of twelve years. And they
were astonished with a great astonishment.

that no man should know it; and
commanded that something should

Chapter 6
Jesus sends forth the Twelve—John the
Baptist is beheaded by Herod—Our
Lord feeds the five thousand, walks on
the water, and heals multitudes.
And he went out from thence, and
came into his own country; and his
disciples follow him.
2 And when the sabbath day was
come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were
astonished, saying, From whence
hath this man these things? and what a wisdom is this which is given unto
him, that even such mighty works
are wrought by his hands?
3 Is not this the a carpenter, the son
of Mary, the b brother of James, and
Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and
are not his sisters here with us?
And they were offended at him.
4 But Jesus said unto them, A
prophet is not without honour, but
in his own country, and among his
own kin, and in his own house.
5 And he could there do no a mighty
work, save that he b laid his c hands
upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
6 And he marvelled because of
their a unbelief. And he went round
about the villages, teaching.
7 ¶ And he called unto him the
a twelve, and began to send them
forth by b two and two; and gave
them power over unclean spirits;
8 And commanded them that they
should take nothing for their jour- ney, save a staff only; no a scrip, no
bread, no money in their purse:
9 But be shod with sandals; and
not put on two coats.
10 And he said unto them, In what
place soever ye enter into an house,
there abide till ye depart from that
place.
11 And whosoever shall not receive
you, nor hear you, when ye depart
thence, shake off the a dust under
your feet for a testimony against
them. Verily I say unto you, It shall
be more tolerable for Sodom and
Gomorrha in the day of judgment,
than for that city.
12 And they went out, and a preached that men should repent.
13 And they cast out many devils,
and a anointed with oil many that
were sick, and healed them.
14 And king a Herod heard of him;
(for his name was spread abroad:)
and he said, That John the Baptist
was risen from the dead, and there- fore mighty works do shew forth
themselves in him.
15 Others said, That it is Elias. And
others said, That it is a prophet, or
as one of the prophets.
16 But when Herod heard thereof,
he said, It is John, whom I beheaded:
he is risen from the dead.
17 For Herod himself had sent
forth and laid hold upon John, and
bound him in prison for Herodias’
sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for
he had married her.
18 For John had said unto Herod,
It is not lawful for thee to have thy
brother’s wife.

quarrel against him, and would
have killed him; but she could not:
20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a a just man b and an
holy, and c observed him; and when
he heard him, he did many things,
and heard him gladly.
21 And when a convenient day was
come, that Herod on his birthday
made a supper to his a lords, high
captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
22 And when the daughter of the
said Herodias came in, and danced,
and pleased Herod and them that
sat with him, the king said unto the
damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou
wilt, and I will give it thee.
23 And he a sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
give it thee, unto the b half of my
kingdom.
24 And she went forth, and said
unto her mother, What shall I ask?
And she said, The head of John the
Baptist.
25 And she came in straightway
with a haste unto the king, and asked,
saying, I will that thou give me b by
and by in a c charger the head of d John the Baptist.
26 And the king was exceeding
sorry; yet for his a oath’s sake, and
for their sakes which sat with him,
b he would not reject her.
27 And immediately the king sent
an executioner, and commanded his
head to be brought: and he went
and beheaded him in the prison,
28 And brought his head in a
charger, and gave it to the damsel:
and the damsel gave it to her mother.
29 And when his disciples heard of
it, they came and took up his corpse,
and laid it in a tomb.
30 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told
him all things, both what they had
done, and what they had taught.
31 And he said unto them, Come
ye yourselves apart into a a desert
place, and rest a while: for there were
many coming and going, and they
had no b leisure so much as to eat.
32 And they departed into a a desert place by ship privately.
33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and
ran afoot thither out of all cities,
and outwent them, and came together unto him.
34 And Jesus, when he came out,
saw much people, and was moved
with a compassion toward them, be- cause they were as sheep not having
a b shepherd: and he began to c teach
them many things.
35 And when the day was now far
spent, his disciples came unto him,
and said, a This is a desert place, and
now the time is far passed:
36 Send them away, that they may
go into the country round about, and
into the villages, and buy themselves
bread: for they have nothing to eat.
37 He answered and said unto
them, Give ye them to eat. And they
say unto him, Shall we go and buy
two hundred a pennyworth of bread,
and give them to eat?
38 He saith unto them, How many
loaves have ye? go and see. And
when they knew, they say, Five,
and two fishes.

make all sit down by companies

40 And they sat down in ranks, by

41 And when he had taken the
five loaves and the two fishes, he
looked up to heaven, and blessed,
and brake the loaves, and gave them
to his disciples to set before them;
and the two fishes divided he among
them all.
42 And they did all eat, and were
filled.
43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of
the fishes.
44 And they that did eat of the
loaves were about a five thousand
men.
45 And straightway he constrained
his disciples to get into the ship,
and to go to the other side before
unto Bethsaida, while he sent away
the people.
46 And when he had a sent them
away, he departed into a mountain
to pray.
47 And when even was come, the
ship was in the midst of the sea,
and he alone on the land.
48 And he saw them a toiling in
rowing; for the wind was contrary
unto them: and about the fourth
watch of the night he cometh unto
them, walking upon the sea, and
would have passed by them.
49 But when they saw him walking
upon the sea, they supposed it had
been a spirit, and cried out:
50 For they all saw him, and were a troubled. And immediately he
talked with them, and saith unto
them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be
not afraid.
51 And he went up unto them into
the ship; and the wind ceased: and
they were sore amazed in themselves
beyond measure, and wondered.
52 For they a considered not the
miracle of the loaves: for their heart
was b hardened.
53 And when they had passed over,
they came into the land of Genne- saret, and drew to the shore.
54 And when they were come out
of the ship, straightway they knew
him,
55 And ran through that whole
region round about, and began to
carry about in beds those that were
sick, where they heard he was.
56 And whithersoever he entered,
into villages, or cities, or country,
they laid the sick in the streets, and
besought him that they might touch
if it were but the border of his gar- ment: and as many as touched him
were made whole.
Chapter 7
Jesus reproves the Pharisees for their
false traditions and ceremonies—He
casts a devil out of the daughter of a
Greek woman—He opens the ears and
loosens the tongue of a person with an
impediment.
Then came together unto him the
Pharisees, and certain of the scribes,
which came from Jerusalem.
2 And when they saw some of his
disciples eat bread with defiled,
that is to say, with unwashen, hands,
they found fault.
3 For the Pharisees, and all the
Jews, except they a wash their hands
oft, eat not, holding the tradition
of the elders.
4 And when they come from the
market, except they wash, they eat
not. And many other things there
be, which they have received to
hold, as the washing of cups, and
pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
5 Then the Pharisees and scribes
asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of
the elders, but eat bread with a un- washen hands?
6 He answered and said unto
them, Well hath Esaias prophesied
of you hypocrites, as it is written,

This people a honoureth me with
their lips, but their heart is far from
me.
7 Howbeit in vain do they worship
me, teaching for doctrines the com- mandments of men.
8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the a tradition
of men, as the washing of pots and
cups: and many other such like
things ye do.
9 And he said unto them, Full
well ye reject the commandment
of God, that ye may keep your own
tradition.
10 a For Moses said, Honour thy
father and thy mother; and, Whoso
b curseth father or mother, let him
die the death:
11 But ye say, If a man shall say to
his father or mother, It is a Corban,
that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever
thou mightest be profited by me;
he shall be free.
12 And ye suffer him no more to do
ought for his father or his mother;
13 Making the word of God of none
effect through your tradition, which
ye have delivered: and many such
like things do ye.
14 ¶ And when he had called all
the people unto him, he said unto
them, Hearken unto me every one
of you, and understand:
15 There is nothing from without
a man, that entering into him can
a defile him: but the things which
come out of him, those are they that
b defile the man.
16 If any man have ears to hear,
let him hear.
17 And when he was entered into
the house from the people, his
disciples asked him concerning
the parable.
18 And he saith unto them, Are
ye so without understanding also?
Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever
thing from without entereth into
the man, it cannot defile him;
19 Because it entereth not into his
heart, but into the belly, and go- eth out into the draught, purging
all meats?
20 And he said, That which cometh
out of the man, that a defileth the
man.
21 For from within, out of the a heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
b adulteries, fornications, murders,
22 a Thefts, b covetousness, c wickedness, d deceit, lasciviousness, an evil
eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
23 All these a evil things come from
within, and b defile the man.
24 ¶ And from thence he arose, and
went into the borders of Tyre and
Sidon, and entered into an house,
a and would have no man know it:
but he could not be hid.
25 For a certain woman, whose
young daughter had an unclean
spirit, heard of him, and came and
fell at his feet:
26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she be- sought him that he would cast forth
the devil out of her daughter.
27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the a children first be filled: for it is not
meet to take the children’s bread,
and to cast it unto the b dogs.
28 And she answered and said
unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
under the table eat of the children’s
crumbs.

bed.
31 ¶ And again, departing from the
coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
unto the sea of Galilee, through the
midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
32 And they bring unto him one
that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech
him to put his a hand upon him.
33 And he took him aside from the
multitude, and put his fingers into
his ears, and he spit, and touched
his tongue;
34 And looking up to heaven, he
sighed, and saith unto him, Eph- phatha, that is, Be opened.
35 And straightway his ears were a opened, and the string of his tongue
was loosed, and he spake plain.
36 And he charged them that they
should tell no man: but the more he
charged them, so much the more a
great deal they a published it;
37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
things well: he maketh both the
deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
Chapter 8
Jesus feeds the four thousand—He
counsels, Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees—He heals a blind man in
Bethsaida—Peter testifies that Jesus
is the Christ.
In those days the multitude being
very great, and having nothing to
eat, Jesus called his disciples unto
him, and saith unto them,
2 I have compassion on the multi- tude, because they have now been
with me three days, and have noth- ing to eat:
3 And if I send them away fasting
to their own houses, they will faint
by the way: for a divers of them came
from far.
4 And his disciples answered him,
From whence can a man satisfy
these men with bread here in the
wilderness?
5 And he asked them, How many
loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
6 And he commanded the people to
sit down on the ground: and he took
the seven loaves, and gave thanks,
and brake, and gave to his disciples
to set before them; and they did set
them before the people.
7 And they had a few small fishes:
and he blessed, and commanded to
set them also before them.
8 So they did eat, and were filled:
and they took up of the broken meat
that was left seven baskets.
9 And they that had eaten were
about four thousand: and he sent
them away.
10 ¶ And straightway he entered
into a ship with his disciples, and
came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
11 And the Pharisees came forth,
and began to question with him,
seeking of him a a sign from heaven,
tempting him.
12 And he sighed deeply in his
spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a a sign? verily I
say unto you, There shall no sign be
given unto this generation.
13 And he left them, and entering
into the ship again departed to the
other side.
14 ¶ Now the disciples had forgot- ten to take bread, neither had they
in the ship with them more than
one loaf.
15 And he charged them, saying,
Take heed, beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees, and of the leaven
of Herod.
16 And they reasoned among them- selves, saying, It is because we have
no bread.
17 And when Jesus knew it, he saith
unto them, Why reason ye, because

20 And when the seven among
four thousand, how many baskets
full of fragments took ye up? And
they said, Seven.
21 And he said unto them, How is
it that ye do not understand?
22 ¶ And he cometh to Bethsaida;
and they bring a blind man unto
him, and besought him to touch
him.
23 And he took the blind man by
the hand, and led him out of the
town; and when he had spit on his
eyes, and put his a hands upon him,
he asked him if he saw b ought.
24 And he looked up, and said, I
see men as trees, walking.
25 After that he put his hands again
upon his eyes, and made him look
up: and he was restored, and saw
a every man clearly.
26 And he sent him away to his
house, saying, Neither go into
the town, nor tell it to any in the
town.
27 ¶ And Jesus went out, and his
disciples, into the towns of Cæsarea
Philippi: and by the way he asked
his disciples, saying unto them,
Whom do men say that I am?
28 And they answered, John the
Baptist: but some say, Elias; and
others, One of the prophets.
29 And he saith unto them, But
whom say ye that I am? And Peter
answereth and saith unto him, Thou
art the a Christ.
30 And he charged them that they
should a tell no man of him.
31 And he began to a teach them,
that the Son of man must suffer
many things, and be rejected of
the elders, and of the chief priests,
and scribes, and be killed, and after
three days rise again.
32 And he spake that saying openly.
And Peter took him, and began to
rebuke him.
33 But when he had turned about
and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind
me, a Satan: for b thou savourest not
the things that be of God, but the
things that be of men.
34 ¶ And when he had called the
people unto him with his disciples
also, he said unto them, Whosoever
will come after me, let him a deny
himself, and take up his cross, and
b follow me.
35 a For whosoever will save his life
shall lose it; but whosoever shall
b lose his c life for my sake and the

36 For what shall it profit a man,
if he shall a gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul?
37 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his a soul?

this adulterous and sinful genera- tion; of him also shall the b Son of
man be ashamed, when he cometh
in the glory of his Father with the

Chapter 9
Jesus is transfigured on the mountain—He casts out an unclean spirit—
He teaches concerning His death and
resurrection, who will be greatest, and
the condemnation of those who offend
His little ones.
And he said unto them, Verily I say
unto you, That there be some of
them that stand here, which shall
not taste of death, till they have
seen the kingdom of God come with
power.
2 ¶ And after a six days Jesus taketh
with him Peter, and James, and John, b and leadeth them up into an high
mountain apart by themselves:
and he was c transfigured before
them.
3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as
no fuller on earth can white them.
4 And there appeared unto them
Elias with a Moses: and they were
talking with Jesus.
5 And Peter answered and said
to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to
be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for
Moses, and one for Elias.
6 For he wist not what to say; for
they were sore afraid.
7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a a voice came
out of the cloud, saying, This is my
b beloved Son: hear him.
8 And suddenly, when they had
looked round about, they saw no
man any more, save Jesus only with
themselves.
9 And as they came down from
the mountain, he charged them that
they should tell no a man what things
they had seen, till the Son of man
were risen from the dead.
10 And they kept that saying with
themselves, questioning one with
another what the a rising from the
dead should mean.
11 ¶ And they asked him, saying,
Why say the scribes that Elias must
first come?
12 And he answered and told
them, Elias verily cometh first, a and b restoreth all things; and how it is
written of the c Son of man, that he
must d suffer many things, and be
set at e nought.
13 But I say unto you, That Elias
is indeed come, and they have done
unto him whatsoever they a listed,
as it is written of b him.
14 ¶ And when he came to his
disciples, he saw a great multitude
about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
15 And straightway all the peo- ple, when they beheld him, were
greatly amazed, and running to him
saluted him.
16 And he asked the scribes, What
question ye with them?
17 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have
brought unto thee my son, which
hath a dumb spirit;
18 And wheresoever he taketh him,
he a teareth him: and he foameth, and
gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth
away: and I spake to thy disciples
that they should cast him out; and
they could not.
19 He answereth him, and saith,
O faithless generation, how long
shall I be with you? how long shall
I suffer you? bring him unto me.

him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit a tare him; and he
fell on the ground, and wallowed
foaming.
21 And he asked his father, How
long is it ago since this came unto
him? And he said, Of a child.
22 And ofttimes it hath cast him
into the fire, and into the waters,
to destroy him: but if thou canst do
any thing, have a compassion on us,
and help us.
23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst
believe, all things are a possible to
him that b believeth.
24 And straightway the father of
the child cried out, and said with
tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine
a unbelief.
25 When Jesus saw that the peo- ple came running together, he a re- buked the b foul spirit, saying unto
him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I
charge thee, come out of him, and
enter no more into him.
26 And the spirit cried, and rent
him sore, and came out of him: and
he was as one dead; insomuch that
many said, He is dead.
27 But Jesus took him by the hand,
and a lifted him up; and he arose.
28 And when he was come into
the house, his disciples asked him
privately, Why could not we cast
him out?
29 And he said unto them, This
kind can come forth by nothing,
but by prayer and a fasting.
30 ¶ And they departed thence,
and passed through Galilee; and
he would not that any man should
know it.
31 For he taught his disciples, and
said unto them, The a Son of man is
delivered into the hands of men,
and they shall kill him; and after
that he is killed, he shall b rise the
third day.
32 But they understood not that
saying, and were afraid to ask him.
33 ¶ And he came to Capernaum:
and being in the house he asked
them, What was it that ye a disputed
among yourselves by the way ?
34 But they held their peace: for
by the way they had a disputed
among themselves, who should be
the b greatest.
35 And he sat down, and called the
twelve, and saith unto them, If any
man desire to be a first, the same shall
be last of all, and b servant of all.
36 And he took a child, and set him
in the midst of them: and when he
had taken him in his arms, he said
unto them,
37 a Whosoever shall receive one
of such b children in my name, re- ceiveth me: and whosoever shall
receive me, receiveth not me, but
him that sent me.
38 ¶ And John answered him, say- ing, Master, we saw one a casting out
devils in thy name, and he followeth
not us: and we forbad him, because
he followeth not us.
39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not:
for there is no man which shall do
a a miracle in my b name, that can
lightly speak evil of me.
40 For he that is not against us is a on our part.

Chapter 10
Jesus teaches the higher law of mar- riage—He blesses little children—Jesus
counsels the rich young man, foretells
His own death, and heals blind Bartimæus.
And he arose from thence, and
cometh into the coasts of Judæa by
the farther side of Jordan: and the
people resort unto him again; and,
as he was wont, he taught them
again.
2 ¶ And the Pharisees came to him,
and asked him, Is it lawful for a
man to put away his wife? tempting
him.
3 And he answered and said unto
them, What did Moses command
you?
4 And they said, Moses suffered to
write a bill of divorcement, and to
put her away.
5 And Jesus answered and said unto
them, For the hardness of your heart
he wrote you this precept.
6 But from the beginning of the
creation God made them male and
female.
7 For this cause shall a a man leave
his father and mother, and cleave
to his b wife;
8 And they twain shall be one flesh:
so then they are no more twain, but
one flesh.
9 What therefore God hath a joined
together, let not man put b asunder.
10 And in the house his disciples
asked him again of the same matter.
11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
marry another, committeth adultery
against her.
12 And if a woman shall put away
her husband, and be married to
another, she committeth adultery.
13 ¶ And they brought young chil- dren to him, that he should touch
them: and his disciples rebuked
those that brought them.
14 But when Jesus saw it, he was
much displeased, and said unto
them, Suffer the little a children to
come unto me, and forbid them not:
for of such is the kingdom of God.
15 Verily I say unto you, Whoso- ever shall not receive the kingdom
of God as a little a child, he shall not

16 And he took them up in his
arms, put his hands upon them, and a blessed them.
17 ¶ And when he was gone forth
into the way, there came one run- ning, and kneeled to him, and asked
him, Good Master, what shall I do
that I may inherit eternal life?
18 And Jesus said unto him, Why
callest thou me good? there is none a good but one, that is, God.
19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit a adultery, Do
not b kill, Do not c steal, Do not bear
false witness, d Defraud not, e Honour
thy father and mother.
20 And he answered and said unto
him, Master, all these have I observed
from my youth.
21 Then Jesus beholding him loved
him, and said unto him, One thing
thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and a give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure
in heaven: and come, take up the
cross, and b follow me.
22 And he was sad at that saying,
and went away grieved: for he had
great possessions.
23 ¶ And Jesus looked round about,
and saith unto his disciples, How
hardly shall they that have riches
enter into the kingdom of God!
24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus an- swereth again, and saith unto them,
Children, how hard is it for them
that a trust in b riches to enter into
the kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle, than
for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God.
26 And they were astonished out of
measure, saying among themselves,
Who then can be saved?
27 And Jesus looking upon them
saith, a With men it is impossible,
but not with God: for with God all
things are b possible.
28 ¶ Then Peter began to say unto
him, Lo, we have left all, and have
followed thee.
29 And Jesus answered and said,
Verily I say unto you, There is no
man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother,
or wife, or children, or lands, for
my sake, and the gospel’s,
30 But he shall receive an a hun- dredfold now in this time, houses,
and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
persecutions; and in the world to
come eternal life.
31 a But many that are b first shall
be last; and the last first.
32 ¶ And they were in the way
going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus
went before them: and they were
amazed; and as they followed, they
were afraid. And he took again the
twelve, and began to tell them what
things should happen unto him,
33 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the a Son of man shall
be delivered unto the chief priests,
and unto the b scribes; and they shall
condemn him to death, and shall
deliver him to the Gentiles:

35 ¶ And James and John, the sons
of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
desire.
36 And he said unto them, What
would ye that I should do for you?
37 They said unto him, Grant unto
us that we may sit, one on thy right
hand, and the other on thy left hand,
in thy glory.
38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye
know not what ye ask: can ye drink
of the cup that I drink of? and be
baptized with the a baptism that I
am baptized with?
39 And they said unto him, We
can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye
shall indeed drink of the cup that
I drink of; and with the baptism
that I am baptized withal shall ye
be baptized:
40 But to sit on my right hand and
on my left hand is not mine to give;
but it shall be given to them for whom
it is prepared.
41 And when the ten heard it, they
began to be much displeased with
James and John.
42 But Jesus called them to him,
and saith unto them, Ye know that
they which are accounted to rule
over the Gentiles exercise lordship
over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
43 But so shall it not be among
you: but whosoever will be a great
among you, shall be your minister:
44 And whosoever of you will be
the a chiefest, shall be servant of all.
45 For even the Son of man came
not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a a ransom for many.
46 ¶ And they came to Jericho:
and as he went out of Jericho with
his disciples and a great number of
people, blind a Bartimæus, the son
of Timæus, sat by the highway side
begging.
47 And when he heard that it was
Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
48 And many charged him that he
should hold his peace: but he cried
the more a great deal, Thou Son of
David, have mercy on me.
49 And Jesus stood still, and com- manded him to be called. And they
call the a blind man, saying unto
him, Be of good comfort, rise; he
calleth thee.
50 And he, casting away his gar- ment, rose, and came to Jesus.
51 And Jesus answered and said
unto him, What wilt thou that I
should do unto thee? The blind man
said unto him, Lord, that I might
receive my sight.
52 And Jesus said unto him, Go
thy way; thy faith hath a made thee
whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus
in the way.
Chapter 11
Jesus rides into Jerusalem amid shouts
of hosanna—He curses a fig tree, drives
the money changers from the temple,
and confounds the scribes on the matter of authority.
And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,
at the mount of Olives, he sendeth
forth two of his disciples,
2 And saith unto them, Go your way
into the village over against you: and
as soon as ye be entered into it, ye
shall find a colt tied, whereon never
man sat; loose him, and bring him.
3 And if any man say unto you,
Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
hath need of him; and straightway
he will send him hither.

5 And certain of them that stood
there said unto them, What do ye,

6 And they said unto them even
as Jesus had commanded: and they
let them go.
7 And they brought the a colt to
Jesus, and cast their garments on
him; and he sat upon him.
8 And many spread their garments
in the way: and others cut down
branches off the trees, and strawed
them in the way.
9 And they that went before, and
they that followed, cried, saying,
Hosanna; a Blessed is he that cometh
in the name of the Lord:
10 a Blessed be the kingdom of our
father David, that cometh in the
name of the Lord: Hosanna in the
highest.
11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when
he had looked round about upon all
things, and now the eventide was
come, he went out unto Bethany
with the twelve.
12 ¶ And on the morrow, when
they were come from Bethany, he
was hungry:
13 And seeing a fig tree afar off
having leaves, he came, if haply
he might find any thing thereon:
and when he came to it, he found
nothing but leaves; for the time of
figs was not yet.
14 And Jesus answered and said
unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.
15 ¶ And they come to Jerusalem:
and Jesus went into the temple, and
began to cast out them that sold and
bought in the temple, and overthrew
the tables of the moneychangers,
and the seats of them that sold
doves;
16 And would not suffer that any
man should carry any vessel through
the temple.
17 And he taught, saying unto
them, Is it not written, My house
shall be called of all nations the
house of prayer? but ye have made
it a den of thieves.
18 And the scribes and chief priests
heard it, and sought how they might a destroy him: for they feared him,
because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
19 And when even was come, he
went out of the city.
20 ¶ And in the morning, as they
passed by, they saw the fig tree dried
up from the roots.
21 And Peter calling to remem- brance saith unto him, Master, be- hold, the fig tree which thou cursedst
is withered away.
22 And Jesus answering saith unto
them, Have a faith in God.
23 For verily I say unto you, That
whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou
cast into the sea; and shall not a doubt
in his heart, but shall believe that
those things which he saith shall
come to pass; he shall have what- soever he saith.
24 Therefore I say unto you, What
things soever ye desire, when ye
a pray, b believe that ye receive them,
and ye shall have them.

who gave thee this authority to do
these things?
29 And Jesus answered and said
unto them, I will also ask of you
one question, and answer me, and
I will tell you by what authority I
do these things.
30 The baptism of John, was it from
heaven, or of men? answer me.
31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
heaven; he will say, Why then did
ye not believe him?
32 But if we shall say, Of men;
they feared the people: for all men
counted John, that he was a prophet
indeed.
33 And they answered and said
unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus
answering saith unto them, Neither
do I tell you by what authority I do
these things.
Chapter 12
Jesus gives the parable of the wicked
husbandmen—He speaks of paying
taxes, celestial marriage, the two great
commandments, the divine sonship of
Christ, and the widow’s mites.
And he began to speak unto them
by parables. A certain man planted
a vineyard, and set an hedge about
it, and digged a place for the winefat,
and built a tower, and let it out to
husbandmen, and went into a far
country.
2 And at the season he sent to the
husbandmen a servant, that he
might receive from the husbandmen
of the fruit of the vineyard.
3 And they caught him, and beat
him, and sent him away empty.
4 And again he sent unto them
another servant; and at him they
cast stones, and wounded him in the
head, and sent him away shamefully
handled.
5 And again he sent another; and
him they killed, and many others;
beating some, and killing some.
6 Having yet therefore one son,
his wellbeloved, he sent him also
last unto them, saying, They will
reverence my son.
7 But those husbandmen said
among themselves, This is the heir;
come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
8 And they took him, and killed
him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
9 What shall therefore the lord of
the vineyard do? he will come and
destroy the husbandmen, and will
give the a vineyard unto others.
10 And have ye not read this scrip- ture; The a stone which the builders
rejected is become the head of the
corner:
11 This was the Lord’s doing, and
it is marvellous in our eyes?
12 And they sought to lay hold
on him, but feared the people: for
they knew that he had spoken the
parable against them: and they left
him, and went their way.
13 ¶ And they send unto him cer- tain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to a catch him in his words.
14 And when they were come, they
say unto him, Master, we know that
thou art true, and carest for no man:
for thou regardest not the person of
men, but teachest the way of God
in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute
to Cæsar, or not?
15 Shall we give, or shall we not
give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why a tempt
ye me? bring me a penny, that I
may see it.
16 And they brought it. And he
saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they
said unto him, Cæsar’s.
17 And Jesus answering said unto
them, Render to Cæsar the things
that are Cæsar’s, and to God the
things that are God’s. And they
marvelled at him.

18 ¶ Then come unto him the
Sadducees, which say there is no
resurrection; and they asked him,
saying,
19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If
a man’s brother die, and leave his
wife behind him, and leave no children, that his a brother should take
his wife, and raise up seed unto his
brother.
20 Now there were seven brethren:
and the first took a wife, and dying
left no seed.
21 And the second took her, and
died, neither left he any seed: and
the third likewise.
22 And the seven had her, and
left no seed: last of all the woman
died also.
23 In the resurrection therefore,
when they shall rise, whose wife
shall she be of them? for the seven
had her to wife.
24 And Jesus answering said unto
them, a Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures,
neither the power of God?
25 For when they shall rise from
the dead, they neither a marry, nor
are given in marriage; but are as the
angels which are in heaven.
26 And as touching the dead, that
they a rise: have ye not read in the
book of Moses, how in the bush God
b spake unto him, saying, I am the c God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
27 a He is not the God of the dead,
but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
28 ¶ And one of the a scribes came,
and having heard them reasoning
together, and perceiving that he
had answered them well, asked
him, Which is the first commandment of all?
29 And Jesus answered him, The
first of all the commandments is, a Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God
is one Lord:
30 And thou shalt a love the Lord
thy God with all thy b heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind, and with all thy c strength:
this is the first commandment.
31 And the second is like, namely
this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
32 And the scribe said unto him,
Well, Master, thou hast said the truth:
for there is one God; and there is
none other but he:
33 And to love him with all the
heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with
all the strength, and to love his
neighbour as himself, is more than
all whole burnt a offerings and sacrifices.
34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him,
Thou art not far from the kingdom
of God. And no man after that durst
ask him any question.
35 ¶ And Jesus answered and said,
while he taught in the temple, How
say the scribes that Christ is the Son
of David?
36 For David himself said by the
Holy Ghost, The a Lord said to my
Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till
I make thine enemies thy footstool.
37 David therefore himself calleth
him Lord; and whence is he then his
son? And the common people heard
him gladly.

doctrine, Beware of the a scribes,

41 ¶ And Jesus sat over against the
treasury, and beheld how the people
cast money into the treasury: and
many that were rich cast in much.
42 And there came a certain a poor
widow, and she threw in two b mites,
which make a farthing.
43 And he called unto him his dis- ciples, and saith unto them, Verily I
say unto you, That this a poor widow
hath cast more in, than all they
which have cast into the treasury:
44 For all they did cast in of their a abundance; but she of her b want
did c cast in d all that she had, even
all her living.
Chapter 13
Jesus tells of the calamities and signs
preceding the Second Coming—There
will be false Christs and false prophets—He gives the parable of the fig tree.
a And as he went out of the temple,
one of his disciples saith unto him,
Master, see what manner of stones
and what buildings are here!
2 And Jesus answering said unto
him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one
stone upon another, that shall not
be thrown down.
3 And as he sat upon the mount
of Olives over against the temple,
Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
4 Tell us, when shall these things
be? and what shall be the a sign when
all these things shall be fulfilled?
5 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man
deceive you:
6 For many shall come in my name,
saying, I am Christ; and shall a deceive many.
7 And when ye shall hear of wars
and rumours of wars, be ye not trou- bled: for such things must needs be;
but the end shall not be yet.
8 For a nation shall rise against na- tion, and kingdom against kingdom:
and there shall be earthquakes in
divers places, and there shall be
famines and troubles: these are the
beginnings of sorrows.
9 ¶ But take heed to yourselves: for
they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall
be beaten: and ye shall be brought
before rulers and a kings for my
sake, for a testimony against them.
10 And the a gospel must first be b published among all nations.
11 But when they shall lead you,
and deliver you up, take no thought
beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatso- ever shall be given you in that hour,
that a speak ye: for it is not ye that
speak, but the b Holy Ghost.
12 Now the brother shall betray
the brother to death, and the father
the son; and children shall rise up
against their parents, and shall cause
them to be put to death.
13 And ye shall be a hated of all
men for my name’s sake: but he that
shall b endure unto the end, the same
shall be saved.
14 ¶ But when ye shall see the
abomination of desolation, spoken
of by Daniel the prophet, standing
where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that
be in Judæa flee to the mountains:

not turn back again for to take up

17 But woe to them that are with
child, and to them that give suck
in those days!
18 And pray ye that your flight be
not in the winter.
19 For in those days shall be a affliction, such as was not from the
beginning of the creation which
God created unto this time, neither
shall be.
20 And except that the Lord had
shortened those days, no flesh
should be saved: but for the a elect’s
sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath
shortened the days.
21 And then if any man shall say
to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he
is there; believe him not:
22 For a false Christs and b false
prophets shall rise, and shall shew
c signs and wonders, to seduce, if it
were possible, even the elect.
23 But take ye heed: behold, I have
foretold you all things.
24 ¶ But in those days, after that
tribulation, the sun shall be dark- ened, and the moon shall not give
her light,
25 And the a stars of heaven shall
fall, and the powers that are in
heaven shall be shaken.
26 And then shall they see the a Son
of man coming in the clouds with
great power and glory.
27 And then shall he send his
angels, and shall gather together
his elect from the four winds, from
the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven.
28 Now learn a parable of the a fig
tree; When her branch is yet tender,
and putteth forth leaves, ye know
that summer is near:
29 So ye in like manner, when ye
shall see these things come to pass,
know that it is nigh, even at the doors.
30 Verily I say unto you, that this a generation shall not pass, till all
these things be done.
31 Heaven and earth shall pass
away: but my a words shall not
pass away.
32 ¶ But of that a day and that hour
knoweth no man, no, not the angels
which are in heaven, neither the
Son, but the Father.
33 Take ye heed, a watch and b pray:
for ye know not when the time is.
34 For the Son of man is as a man
taking a far journey, who left his
house, and gave a authority to his
servants, and to every man his work,
and commanded the porter to watch.
35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know
not when the master of the house
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at
the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
36 Lest coming suddenly he find
you a sleeping.
37 And what I say unto you I say
unto all, Watch.

Peter denies that he knows Him.

the passover, and of unleavened

the a scribes sought how they might
take him by craft, and put him to b death.

3 ¶ And being in Bethany in the
house of Simon the leper, as he sat at
meat, there came a woman having an
alabaster box of ointment of spike- nard very precious; and she brake
the box, and poured it on his head.
4 And there were some that had
indignation within themselves, and
said, Why was this a waste of the
ointment made?
5 For it might have been sold for
more than three hundred pence,
and have been given to the poor.
And they murmured against her.
6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why
trouble ye her? she hath wrought a
good work on me.
7 For ye have the a poor with you
always, and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good: but me ye have
not always.
8 She hath done what she could: a she is come aforehand to anoint
my body to the burying.
9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
throughout the whole world, this also
that a she hath done shall be spoken
of for a memorial of her.
10 ¶ And Judas Iscariot, one of the
twelve, went unto the chief priests,
a to betray him unto them.
11 And when they heard it, they
were glad, and promised to give him
money. And he sought how he might
conveniently betray him.
12 ¶ And the first day of unleavened
bread, when they killed the passover,
his disciples said unto him, Where
wilt thou that we go and prepare
that thou mayest eat the a passover?
13 And he sendeth forth two of
his a disciples, and saith unto them,
Go ye into the city, and there shall
meet you a man bearing a pitcher
of water: follow him.
14 And wheresoever he shall go
in, say ye to the goodman of the
house, The Master saith, Where is
the guestchamber, where I shall eat
the passover with my disciples?
15 And he will shew you a large
upper room furnished and prepared:
there make ready for us.
16 And his disciples went forth,
and came into the city, and found
as he had said unto them: and they
made ready the passover.
17 And in the evening he cometh
with the twelve.
18 And as they sat and did eat,
Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
One of you which eateth with me
shall betray me.
19 And they began to be sorrowful,
and to say unto him one by one, Is
it I? and another said, Is it I?
20 And he answered and said unto
them, It is one of the twelve, that
dippeth with me in the dish.
21 The Son of man indeed goeth,
as it is written of him: but woe to
that man by whom the Son of man
is betrayed! good were it for that
man if he had never been born.
22 ¶ a And as they did eat, Jesus
took b bread, and blessed, and brake
it, and gave to them, and said, Take,
eat: this is my c body.
23 And he took the cup, and when
he had given a thanks, he gave it to
them: and they all drank of it.
24 And he said unto them, This
is my blood of the new testament,
which is shed for many.
25 Verily I say unto you, I will a drink no more of the fruit of the
vine, until that day that I drink it
new in the kingdom of God.
26 ¶ And when they had sung an

shall be scattered.
28 But after that I am risen, I will
go before you into Galilee.
29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
will not I.
30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily
I say unto thee, That this day, even
in this night, before the cock crow
twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee,
I will not deny thee in any wise.
Likewise also said they all.
32 a And they came to a place which
was named Gethsemane: and he
saith to his disciples, Sit ye here,
while I shall pray.
33 And he taketh with him Peter
and James and John, and began to be
a sore amazed, and to be b very c heavy;
34 And saith unto them, My soul
is exceeding sorrowful unto death:
tarry ye here, and watch.
35 And he went forward a little,
and fell on the ground, and prayed
that, if it were possible, the hour
might pass from him.
36 And he said, Abba, Father, all
things are possible unto thee; a take
away this b cup from me: nevertheless
not what I will, but what thou wilt.
37 And he cometh, and findeth
them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not
thou watch one a hour?
38 a Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter
into b temptation. The spirit truly is
ready, but the flesh is weak.
39 And again he went away, and
prayed, and spake the same words.
40 And when he returned, he found
them asleep again, (for their eyes
were heavy,) neither wist they what
to answer him.
41 And he cometh the third time,
and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
and take your rest: it is enough, the
hour is come; behold, the Son of
man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners.
42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that
betrayeth me is at hand.
43 ¶ And immediately, while he
yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
the chief priests and the scribes and
the elders.
44 And he that a betrayed him had
given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he;
take him, and lead him away safely.
45 And as soon as he was come, he
goeth straightway to him, and saith,
Master, master; and kissed him.
46 ¶ And they laid their hands on
him, and took him.
47 And one of them that stood by
drew a sword, and smote a servant
of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
48 And Jesus answered and said
unto them, Are ye come out, as
against a thief, with swords and
with staves to take me?
49 I was daily with you in the
temple teaching, and ye took me not:
but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
50 And they all forsook him, and
fled.
51 And there followed him a cer- tain young man, a having a linen
cloth cast about his naked body; and
the young men laid hold on him:
52 And he left the linen cloth, and
fled from them naked.
53 ¶ And they led Jesus away to
the high priest: and with him were
assembled all the chief priests and
the elders and the scribes.
54 And Peter followed him afar
off, even into the palace of the high
priest: and he sat with the servants,
and warmed himself at the fire.

council sought for witness against

Jesus to put him to a death; and
found none.
56 For many bare a false witness
against him, but their witness agreed
not together.
57 And there arose certain, and
bare false witness against him,
saying,
58 We heard him say, I will destroy this a temple that is made
with hands, and within three days
I will build another made without
hands.
59 But neither so did their witness
agree together.
60 And the high priest stood up
in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what
is it which these witness against
thee?
61 But he held his peace, and a an- swered nothing. Again the high
priest asked him, and said unto
him, Art thou the b Christ, the Son
of the Blessed?
62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall
see the a Son of man sitting on the
right hand of power, and coming in
the clouds of heaven.
63 Then the high priest rent his
clothes, and saith, What need we
any further witnesses?
64 Ye have heard the blasphemy:
what think ye? And they all a con- demned him to be b guilty of death.
65 And some began to spit on him,
and to cover his face, and to buffet
him, and to say unto him, Prophesy:
and the servants did strike him with
the palms of their hands.
66 ¶ And as Peter was beneath in
the palace, there cometh one of the
maids of the high priest:
67 And when she saw Peter warm- ing himself, she looked upon him,
and said, And thou also wast with
Jesus of Nazareth.
68 But he denied, saying, I know
not, neither understand I what thou
sayest. And he went out into the
porch; and the cock crew.
69 And a maid saw him again, and
began to say to them that stood by,
This is one of them.
70 And he denied it again. And a
little after, they that stood by said
again to Peter, Surely thou art one of
them: for thou art a Galilæan, and
thy speech agreeth thereto.
71 But he began to curse and to
swear, saying, I know not this man
of whom ye speak.
72 And the second time the cock
crew. And Peter called to mind
the word that Jesus said unto him,
Before the cock crow twice, thou
shalt deny me thrice. And when he
thought thereon, he wept.
Chapter 15
Pilate decrees the death of Jesus—Jesus
is mocked and crucified between two
thieves—He dies and is buried in the
tomb of Joseph of Arimathæa.
And straightway in the morning
the chief priests held a consultation
with the elders and scribes and the
whole council, and bound Jesus, and
carried him away, and delivered him
to Pilate.
2 And a Pilate asked him, Art thou
the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, b Thou sayest it.
3 And the chief priests accused
him of many things: but he a answered nothing.
4 And Pilate asked him again,
saying, Answerest thou nothing?
behold how many things they witness against thee.
5 But Jesus yet answered nothing;
so that Pilate marvelled.
6 Now at that feast he a released
unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.

7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them
that had made insurrection with
him, who had committed murder
in the insurrection.
8 And the multitude crying aloud
began to desire him to do as he had
ever done unto them.
9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you
the a King of the Jews?
10 For he knew that the chief
priests had delivered him for a envy.
11 But the chief priests moved the
people, that he should rather release
Barabbas unto them.
12 And Pilate answered and said
again unto them, What will ye then
that I shall do unto him whom ye
call the King of the Jews?
13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.
14 Then Pilate said unto them,
Why, what evil hath he done? And
they cried out the more exceedingly,
Crucify him.
15 ¶ And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
unto them, and delivered Jesus,
when he had scourged him, to be
crucified.
16 And the soldiers led him away
into the hall, called Prætorium; and
they call together the whole band.
17 And they clothed him with purple, and plaited a crown of a thorns,
and put it about his head,
18 And began to salute him, Hail,
King of the Jews!
19 And they a smote him on the
head with a reed, and did spit upon
him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
20 And when they had a mocked
him, they took off the purple from
him, and put his own clothes on
him, and led him out to crucify him.
21 And they compel one Simon a
Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
of the country, the father of Alex- ander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
22 And they bring him unto the
place Golgotha, which is, being in- terpreted, The place of a skull.
23 And they gave him to drink
wine mingled with myrrh: but he
received it not.
24 And when they had crucified
him, they parted his a garments,
casting lots upon them, what every
man should take.
25 And it was the third hour, and
they crucified him.
26 And the superscription of his
accusation was written over, The
King of the Jews. 27 And with him they crucify two a thieves; the one on his right hand,
and the other on his left.
28 And the scripture was a fulfilled,
which saith, And he was numbered
with the transgressors.
29 And they that passed by railed
on him, wagging their heads, and
saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the
temple, and buildest it in three days,
30 Save thyself, and come down
from the cross.
31 Likewise also the chief priests
mocking said among themselves
with the scribes, He saved others;
himself he cannot save.
32 Let Christ the King of Israel
descend now from the cross, that
we may see and believe. And they
that were crucified with him a re- viled him.
33 And when the sixth hour was
come, there was a darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour.
34 And at the ninth hour Jesus
cried with a loud voice, saying,
a Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which
is, being interpreted, My God, my
God, why hast thou b forsaken me?

36 And one ran and filled a sponge
full of a vinegar, and put it on a reed,
and gave him to drink, saying, Let
alone; let us see whether Elias will
come to take him down.
37 And Jesus cried with a loud
voice, and gave up the a ghost.
38 And the veil of the temple was
rent in twain from the top to the
bottom.
39 ¶ And when the centurion,
which stood over against him, saw
that he so cried out, and gave up the
ghost, he said, Truly this man was
the Son of God.
40 There were also women looking
on afar off: among whom was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother
of James the less and of Joses, and
Salome;
41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered
unto him;) and many other women
which came up with him unto
Jerusalem.
42 ¶ And now when the even was
come, because it was the a preparation,
that is, the day before the sabbath,
43 Joseph of Arimathæa, an honourable a counsellor, which also
waited for the kingdom of God,
came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and b craved the body of Jesus.
44 And Pilate marvelled if he were
already dead: and calling unto him
the centurion, he asked him whether
he had been any while dead.
45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
46 And he bought fine linen, and
took him down, and wrapped him in
the linen, and laid him in a a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,
and rolled a stone unto the door of
the sepulchre.
47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary
the mother of Joses beheld where he
was laid.
Chapter 16
Christ is risen—He appears to Mary
Magdalene, then to others—He sends
the Apostles to preach and promises
that signs will follow faith—He ascends
into heaven.
And when the sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James, and Salome, had
bought sweet spices, that they might
come and anoint him.
2 And very early in the morning
the a first day of the week, they came
unto the sepulchre at the b rising of
the sun.
3 And they said among themselves,
Who shall roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre?
4 a And when they looked, they saw
that the stone was rolled away: for
it was very great.
5 And entering into the sepulchre,
they saw a young man sitting on the
right side, a clothed in a long white
garment; and they were b affrighted.
6 And he saith unto them, Be not
affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth,
which was crucified: he is a risen; he
is not here: behold the place where
they laid him.
7 But go your way, tell his disciples
and Peter that he goeth before you
into Galilee: there shall ye see him,
as he said unto you.
8 And they went out quickly, and
fled from the sepulchre; for they
trembled and were amazed: neither
said they any thing to any man; for
they were afraid.
9 ¶ Now when Jesus was a risen
early the first day of the week, he b appeared first to c Mary Magdalene,
out of whom he had cast seven devils.
10 And she went and told them
that had been with him, as they
mourned and wept.

12 ¶ After that he appeared in
another form unto two of them,
as they walked, and went into the
country.
13 And they went and told it unto
the residue: neither believed they
them.
14 ¶ Afterward he appeared unto
the a eleven as they sat at meat, and
upbraided them with their b unbelief and c hardness of heart, because
they believed not them which had
seen him after he was risen.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO
ST LUKE
CHAPTER 1
Gabriel promises Zacharias that Elisabeth will bear a son, whom they will
name John—He also tells Mary that
she will be the mother of the Son of
God—Mary visits Elisabeth and utters
a psalm of praise—John the Baptist is
born—Zacharias prophesies of John’s
mission.
a FORASMUCH as b  many have
taken in hand to set forth in
order a declaration of those
things c which are most surely believed among us,
2 Even as they delivered them
unto us, which from the beginning
were a eyewitnesses, and ministers
of the word;
3 It seemed good to me also, having 
Luke 1:4–23 1272
had perfect understanding of all
things from the very first, to write
unto thee in order, most excellent
a Theophilus,
4 That thou mightest a know the
certainty of those things, wherein
thou hast been instructed.
5 ¶ There was in the days of
Herod, the king of Judæa,
a certain priest named a Zacharias, of the course of b Abia:
and his wife was of the daughters of
Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
6 And they were both righteous
before God, walking in all the com- mandments and a ordinances of the
Lord blameless.
7 And they had no child, because
that Elisabeth was a barren, and
they both were now well b stricken
in years.
8 And it came to pass, that while
he executed the a priest’s office before God in the order of his b course,
9 According to the custom of the a priest’s office, his lot was to burn
incense when he went into the
temple of the Lord.
10 And the whole multitude of the
people were praying without at the
time of incense.
11 And there appeared unto him
an angel of the Lord standing on
the right side of the altar of incense.
12 And when Zacharias saw him,
he was troubled, and fear fell upon
him.
13 But the angel said unto him, a Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is
heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall
bear thee a b son, and thou shalt call
his name John.
14 And thou shalt have joy and
gladness; and many shall rejoice
at his birth.
15 For he shall be great in the sight
of the Lord, and shall drink neither
a wine nor strong drink; and he shall
be b filled with the c Holy Ghost, even
from his mother’s womb.
16 And many of the children of
Israel shall he turn to the Lord
their God.
17 And he shall go before him in
the spirit and power of a Elias, to
turn the hearts of the b fathers to the
children, and the c disobedient to
the wisdom of the just; to make ready
a people d prepared for the Lord.
18 And Zacharias said unto the
angel, Whereby shall I a know this?
for I am an b old man, and my wife
well c stricken in years.
19 And the a angel answering said
unto him, I am b Gabriel, that stand
in the presence of God; and am sent
to speak unto thee, and to shew thee
these glad tidings.
20 And, behold, thou shalt be a dumb, and not able to speak, until
the day that these things shall be
performed, because thou b believest
not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
21 And the people waited for
Zacharias, and marvelled that he
tarried so long in the temple.
22 And when he came out, he could
not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in
the temple: for he beckoned unto
them, and remained speechless.
23 And it came to pass, that, as

were accomplished, he departed to
his own house.
24 And after those days his wife
Elisabeth conceived, and hid her- self five months, saying,
25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with
me in the days wherein he looked
on me, to take away my a reproach
among men.
26 And in the sixth month the a angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
27 To a a virgin espoused to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the
house of David; and the virgin’s
name was Mary.
28 And the angel came in unto her,
and said, Hail, thou that art highly
favoured, the Lord is with thee:
blessed art thou among a women.
29 And when she saw him, she was
troubled at his saying, and cast in
her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
30 And the angel said unto her, a Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found
favour with God.
31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive
in thy womb, and bring forth a son,
and shalt call his name a Jesus. 32 He shall be great, and shall be
called the a Son of the Highest: and
the Lord God shall give unto him
the b throne of his father c David:
33 And he shall a reign over the
house of Jacob for ever; and of his
kingdom there shall be no b end.
34 Then said Mary unto the angel,
How shall this be, seeing I a know
not a man?
35 And the angel answered and
said unto her, The a Holy Ghost shall
come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee:
therefore also that holy thing which
shall be born of thee shall be called
the b Son of God.
36 And, behold, thy a cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son
in her b old age: and this is the sixth
month with her, who was called
barren.
37 For with God nothing shall be a impossible.
38 And Mary said, Behold the
handmaid of the Lord; be it unto
me according to thy word. And the
angel departed from her.
39 And Mary arose in those days,
and went into the hill country with
haste, into a city of Juda;
40 And entered into the house of
Zacharias, and a saluted Elisabeth.
41 And it came to pass, that, when
Elisabeth heard the salutation of
Mary, the babe leaped in her womb;
and Elisabeth was a filled with the
Holy Ghost:
42 And she spake out with a loud
voice, and said, Blessed art thou
among a women, and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb.
43 And a whence is this to me, that
the mother of my Lord should come
to me?
44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of
thy salutation sounded in mine ears,
the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
45 And blessed is she that believed:
for there shall be a performance of
those things which were told her
from the Lord.
46 And Mary a said, My soul doth b magnify the Lord,
47 And my spirit hath a rejoiced in
God my b Saviour.

48 For he hath regarded the low
estate of his a handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me b blessed.
49 For he that is mighty hath done
to me great a things; and b holy is
his name.
50 And his mercy is on them that
fear him from generation to gen- eration.
51 He hath shewed strength with
his arm; he hath scattered the
a proud in the imagination of their
hearts.
52 He hath put down the mighty
from their seats, and exalted them
of a low degree.
53 He hath filled the hungry with
good things; and the rich he hath
sent empty away.
54 He hath a holpen his servant Is- rael, in remembrance of his mercy;
55 As he spake to our a fathers, to
Abraham, and to his b seed for ever.
56 And Mary abode with her about
three months, and returned to her
own house.
57 Now Elisabeth’s full time came
that she should be delivered; and
she brought forth a son.
58 And her neighbours and her a cousins heard how the Lord had
shewed great b mercy upon her; and
they rejoiced with her.
59 And it came to pass, that on
the a eighth day they came to b cir- cumcise the child; and they called
him Zacharias, after the name of
his father.
60 And his mother answered and
said, Not so; but he shall be called
John.
61 And they said unto her, There
is none of thy kindred that is called
by this name.
62 And they made signs to his
father, how he would have him
called.
63 And he asked for a a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is
John. And they marvelled all.
64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and
he spake, and praised God.
65 And fear came on all that dwelt
round about them: and all these say- ings were a noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa.
66 And all they that heard them laid
them up in their hearts, saying, What
manner of child shall this be! And
the hand of the Lord was with him.
67 And his father Zacharias was
filled with the Holy Ghost, and
a prophesied, saying,
68 a Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel; for he hath b visited and c redeemed his people,
69 And hath raised up an horn of
salvation for us in the house of his
servant David;
70 As he a spake by the mouth of
his holy b prophets, which have been
since the world began:
71 That we should be saved from
our enemies, and from the hand of
all that hate us;
72 To perform the mercy a promised
to our fathers, and to remember his
holy b covenant;
73 The a oath which he sware to
our b father Abraham,
74 That he would grant unto us,
that we being delivered out of the
hand of our enemies might serve
him without a fear,
75 In a holiness and righteousness
before him, all the days of our life.

Chapter 2
Heavenly messengers herald the birth
of Jesus in Bethlehem—He is circumcised, and Simeon and Anna prophesy
of His mission—At twelve years of age,
He goes about His Father’s business.
And it came to pass in those days,
that there went out a decree from
Cæsar Augustus, that all a the world
should be b taxed.
2 (And this a taxing was first made
when Cyrenius was governor of
Syria.)
3 And all went to be taxed, every
one into his own city.
4 And Joseph also went up from
Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judæa, unto the city of David,
which is called a Bethlehem; (be- cause he was of the house and lineage of David:)
5 To be taxed with Mary his a es- poused wife, being great with child.
6 And so it was, that, while they
were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
7 And she brought forth her a firstborn son, and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him
in a manger; because there was no
room for them in the b inn.
8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by
night.
9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord
came upon them, and the a glory of
the Lord shone round about them:
and they were sore afraid.
10 And the angel said unto them,
Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
a good tidings of great b joy, which
shall be to all people.
11 For unto you is a born this day in
the city of David a b Saviour, which
is Christ the c Lord.
12 And this shall be a a sign unto
you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped
in swaddling clothes, lying in a
manger.
13 And suddenly there was with
the angel a multitude of the heav- enly host praising God, and saying,
14 a Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth b peace, good will toward men.
15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into
heaven, the shepherds said one to
another, Let us now go even unto
Bethlehem, and see this thing which
is come to pass, which the Lord hath
made known unto us.
16 And they came with a haste, and
found Mary, and Joseph, and the
babe lying in a manger.
17 And when they had seen it,
they made known abroad the saying
which was told them concerning
this child.

18 And all they that heard it a wondered at those things which were
told them by the shepherds.
19 But Mary kept all these things,
and a pondered them in her heart.
20 And the shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God for all
the things that they had heard and
seen, as it was told unto them.
21 And when eight days were accomplished for the a circumcising
of the child, his name was called
b Jesus, which was so c named of
the angel before he was conceived
in the womb.
22 And when the days of her a pu- rification according to the law of
Moses were accomplished, they
brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
23 (As it is written in the law of
the Lord, Every male that openeth
the a womb shall be called holy
to the Lord;)
24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law
of the Lord, A pair of a turtledoves,
or two young pigeons.
25 And, behold, there was a man
in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and
devout, waiting for the consolation
of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was
upon him.
26 And it was revealed unto him
by the Holy Ghost, that he should
not see death, before he had seen
the Lord’s Christ.
27 And he came by the Spirit into
the temple: and when the parents
brought in the child Jesus, to do for
him after the custom of the law,
28 Then took he him up in his arms,
and blessed God, and said,
29 Lord, now lettest thou thy ser- vant depart in peace, according to
thy word:
30 For mine eyes have seen thy a salvation,
31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
32 A a light b to lighten the Gentiles,
and the glory of thy people Israel.
33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
spoken of him.
34 And Simeon blessed them, and
said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
this child is a set for the b fall and
rising again of many in Israel; and
for a sign which shall be spoken
against;
35 (Yea, a sword shall a pierce
through thy own soul also,) that the
thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed.
36 And there was one Anna,
a a prophetess, the daughter of
Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she
was of a great age, and had lived
with an husband seven years from
her virginity;
37 And she was a widow of about
fourscore and four years, which
departed not from the temple,
but served God with a fastings and
prayers night and day.
38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto
the Lord, and spake of him to all
them that looked for a redemption in
Jerusalem.
39 And when they had performed
all things according to the law of
the Lord, they returned into Galilee,
to their own city Nazareth.
40 And the child grew, and a waxed
strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:
and the b grace of God was upon
him.
41 Now his parents went to Jeru- salem every year at the a feast of
the passover.

old, they went up to Jerusalem after
the custom of the feast.
43 And when they had fulfilled
the days, as they returned, the child
Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem;
and Joseph and his mother knew
not of it.
44 But they, supposing him to have
been in the company, went a day’s
journey; and they sought him among
their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
45 And when they found him not,
they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
46 And it came to pass, that after
three days they found him in the
a temple, sitting in the midst of the
b doctors, c both hearing them, and d asking them questions.
47 And all that heard him were
astonished at his a understanding
and answers.
48 And when they saw him, they
were amazed: and his mother said
unto him, Son, why hast thou thus
dealt with us? behold, thy father
and I have sought thee sorrowing.
49 And he said unto them, How is
it that ye sought me? a wist ye not
that I must be about my b Father’s
business?
50 And they understood not the
saying which he spake unto them.
51 And he went down with
them, and came to Nazareth, and
was a subject unto them: but his
mother kept all these sayings in her

John the Baptist preaches and baptizes—
Jesus is baptized, and God acclaims Him
as His Son—Jesus’ genealogy back to
Adam is given.
Now in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pi- late being governor of Judæa, and
a Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip tetrarch of
Ituræa and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of
Abilene,
2 a Annas and Caiaphas being the b high priests, the word of God came
unto John the son of Zacharias in
the wilderness.
3 And he came into all the country
about Jordan, preaching the a baptism of repentance for the b remis- sion of sins;
4 a As it is written in the book of
the words of Esaias the prophet,
saying, The b voice of one crying in
the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make his paths straight.
5 Every a valley shall be filled, and
every mountain and hill shall be
brought low; and the crooked shall
be made straight, and the rough
ways shall be made smooth;
6 And all flesh shall see the a sal- vation of God.
7 Then said he to the multitude
that came forth to be baptized of
him, O a generation of vipers, who
hath warned you to flee from the
wrath to come?

not to say within yourselves, d We
have e Abraham to our father: for I
say unto you, That God is able of
these stones to raise up children unto
Abraham.
9 And now also the a axe is laid
unto the root of the trees: every tree
therefore which bringeth not forth
good b fruit is hewn down, and cast
into the fire.
10 And the people asked him, say- ing, What shall we do then?
11 He answereth and saith unto
them, He that hath two a coats, let
him b impart to him that hath none;
and he that hath meat, let him do
likewise.
12 Then came also a publicans to
be baptized, and said unto him,
Master, what shall we do?
13 a And he said unto them, Exact
no more than that which is ap- pointed you.
14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
shall we do? And he said unto them,
Do violence to no man, neither ac- cuse any a falsely; and be b content
with your c wages.
15 And as the people were in ex- pectation, and all men a mused in
their hearts of b John, whether he
were the Christ, or not;
16 John answered, saying unto them
all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh,
the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to unloose: he shall a baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
with fire:
17 Whose a fan is in his hand, and
he will throughly purge his floor,
and will gather the wheat into his
b garner; but the c chaff he will burn
with fire unquenchable.
18 And many other things in his
exhortation preached he unto the
people.
19 But a Herod the tetrarch, being
reproved by him for Herodias his
brother Philip’s wife, and for all the
evils which Herod had done,
20 Added yet this above all, that
he shut up John in prison.
21 Now when all the people were
baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus
also being a baptized, and praying,
the heaven was opened,
22 And the a Holy Ghost descended
in a bodily shape like a b dove upon
him, and a voice came from heaven,
which said, Thou art my beloved
Son; in thee I am well pleased.

about b thirty years of age, being (as

Chapter 4
Jesus fasts forty days and is tempted by
the devil—Jesus announces His divine
sonship in Nazareth and is rejected—He
casts out a devil in Capernaum, heals
Peter’s mother-in-law, and preaches and
heals throughout Galilee.
And Jesus being full of the Holy
Ghost returned from Jordan, and was
a led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
2 a Being forty days b tempted of the c devil. And in those days he did eat
nothing: and when they were ended,
he afterward hungered.
3 And the devil said unto him, If
thou be the Son of God, command
this stone that it be made bread.
4 And Jesus answered him, saying,
It is written, That a man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every
word of God.
5 a And the devil, taking him up
into an high mountain, shewed unto
him all the kingdoms of the world
in a moment of time.
6 And the devil said unto him, All
this a power will I give thee, and the
glory of them: for that is delivered
unto me; and to whomsoever I will
I give it.

8 And Jesus answered and said unto
him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for
it is written, Thou shalt a worship the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt
thou b serve.
9 a And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of
the temple, and said unto him, If
thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
down from hence:
10 For it is written, He shall give his a angels charge over thee, to keep thee:
11 And in their hands they shall
bear thee up, lest at any time thou
dash thy foot against a stone.
12 And Jesus answering said unto
him, It is said, Thou shalt not a tempt
the Lord thy God.
13 And when the devil had ended
all the temptation, he departed from
him for a season.
14 ¶ And Jesus returned in the a power of the Spirit into b Galilee:
and there went out a fame of him
through all the region round about.
15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
16 ¶ And he came to Nazareth,
where he had been brought up: and,
as his custom was, he went into the
synagogue on the sabbath day, and
stood up for to read.
17 And there was delivered unto him
the book of the prophet Esaias. And
when he had opened the book, he
found the place where it was written,
18 The a Spirit of the Lord is upon
me, because he hath b anointed me
to c preach the d gospel to the e poor;
he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to f preach g deliverance
to the h captives, and recovering of
sight to the blind, to set at i liberty
them that are bruised,
19 a To preach the acceptable year
of the Lord.
20 And he closed the book, and he
gave it again to the minister, and
sat down. And the eyes of all them
that were in the synagogue were
fastened on him.
21 And he began to say unto them,
This day is this scripture a fulfilled
in your ears.
22 And all bare him witness, and a wondered at the b gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth.
And they said, Is not this c Joseph’s
son?
23 And he said unto them, Ye will
surely say unto me this proverb,
Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever
we have heard done in a Capernaum, b do also here in thy country.
24 And he said, Verily I say unto
you, No prophet is a accepted in his
own country.
25 But I tell you of a truth, many a widows were in Israel in the days
of b Elias, when the heaven was
shut up three years and six months,
when great famine was throughout
all the land;
26 But unto none of them was Elias
sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Si- don, unto a woman that was a widow.
27 And many a lepers were in Israel
in the time of Eliseus the prophet;
and none of them was b cleansed,
saving Naaman the Syrian.

28 And all they in the synagogue,
when they heard these things, were
filled with wrath,
29 And rose up, and thrust him
out of the city, and led him unto
the brow of the hill whereon their
city was built, that they might cast
him down headlong.
30 But he a passing through the
midst of them went his way,
31 And came down to Capernaum,
a city of Galilee, and taught them
on the sabbath days.
32 And they were astonished at
his doctrine: for his word was with
a power.
33 ¶ And in the synagogue there
was a man, which had a spirit of an
unclean devil, and cried out with
a loud voice,
34 Saying, Let us alone; what have
we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
Nazareth? art thou come to destroy
us? I know thee who thou art; the
Holy One of God.
35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying,
Hold thy peace, and come out of
him. And when the devil had thrown
him in the midst, he came out
of him, and hurt him not.
36 And they were all amazed, and
spake among themselves, saying,
What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the
a unclean spirits, and they come out.
37 And the fame of him went out
into every place of the country
round about.
38 ¶ And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s
house. And Simon’s wife’s mother
was taken with a great fever; and
they besought him for her.
39 And he stood over her, and a re- buked the fever; and it left her: and
immediately she arose and minis- tered unto them.
40 ¶ Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick
with a divers diseases brought them
unto him; and he b laid his c hands
on every one of them, and healed
them.
41 And devils also came out of
many, crying out, and saying, Thou
art a Christ the Son of God. And he
rebuking them suffered them not to
speak: for they knew that he was
Christ.
42 And when it was day, he a departed and went into a b desert place:
and the people sought him, and came
unto him, and c stayed him, that he
should not depart from them.
43 And he said unto them, I must a preach the kingdom of God to other
cities also: for therefore am I b sent.
44 And he preached in the syna- gogues of a Galilee.

And it came to pass, that, as the
people pressed upon him to hear
the word of God, he stood by the
lake of Gennesaret,
2 And saw two ships standing by
the lake: but the fishermen were
gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
3 And he entered into one of
the ships, which was Simon’s, and
prayed him that he would thrust out
a little from the land. And he sat
down, and taught the people out of
the ship.
4 Now when he had left speaking,
he said unto Simon, Launch out into
the deep, and let down your nets
for a a draught.

him, Master, we have a toiled all
the night, and have taken nothing:
nevertheless at thy word I will let
down the net.
6 And when they had this done,
they inclosed a great multitude of
fishes: and their net a brake.
7 And they beckoned unto their
partners, which were in the other
ship, that they should come and
help them. And they came, and
filled both the ships, so that they
began to sink.
8 When Simon Peter saw it, he
fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,
Depart from me; for I am a sinful
man, O Lord.
9 For he was astonished, and all
that were with him, at the draught
of the fishes which they had taken:
10 And so was also James, and John,
the sons of Zebedee, which were
partners with Simon. And Jesus said
unto Simon, Fear not; from hence- forth thou shalt a catch men.
11 And when they had brought
their ships to land, they a forsook
all, and b followed him.
12 ¶ And it came to pass, when he
was in a certain city, behold a man
full of a leprosy: who seeing Jesus
fell on his face, and besought him,
saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst
make me clean.
13 And he put forth his hand, and
touched him, saying, I will: be thou
clean. And immediately the leprosy
departed from him.
14 And he charged him to tell no
man: but go, and shew thyself to the
a priest, and offer for thy cleansing,
according as Moses commanded, for
a testimony unto them.
15 But so much the more went
there a fame abroad of him: and
great multitudes came together to
hear, and to be healed by him of
their infirmities.
16 ¶ And he a withdrew himself
into the wilderness, and prayed.
17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
there were Pharisees and doctors
of the law sitting by, which were
come out of every town of Galilee,
and Judæa, and Jerusalem: and the
power of the Lord was present to heal
them.
18 ¶ And, behold, men brought in
a bed a man which was a taken with
a palsy: and they sought means to
bring him in, and to lay him before
him.
19 And when they could not find
by what way they might bring him
in because of the multitude, they
went upon the housetop, and let
him down through the tiling with
his couch into the midst before
Jesus.
20 And when he saw their faith,
he said unto him, Man, thy sins are
a forgiven thee.
21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who
is this which speaketh a blasphe- mies? Who can b forgive sins, but
God alone?
22 But when Jesus a perceived their
thoughts, he answering said unto
them, What reason ye in your hearts?
23 a Whether is easier, to say, Thy
sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise
up and walk?
24 But that ye may know that the
Son of man hath power upon earth
to a forgive sins, (he said unto the
sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee,
Arise, and take up thy couch, and
go into thine house.
25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon
he lay, and departed to his own
house, a glorifying God.
26 And they were all amazed, and
they glorified God, and were filled

27 ¶ And after these things he went
forth, and saw a publican, named
a Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom:
and he said unto him, Follow me.
28 And he left all, rose up, and
followed him.
29 And Levi made him a great feast
in his own house: and there was a
great company of publicans and
of others that sat down with them.
30 But their scribes and Pharisees
murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with
publicans and sinners?
31 And Jesus answering said unto
them, They that are whole need
not a physician; but they that are
sick.
32 I came not to call the righteous,
but a sinners to repentance.
33 ¶ And they said unto him, Why
do the disciples of John a fast often,
and make prayers, and likewise the
disciples of the Pharisees; but thine
eat and drink?
34 And he said unto them, Can ye
make the children of the a bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom
is with them?
35 But the days will come, when
the a bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then shall they b fast
in those days.
36 ¶ And he spake also a parable
unto them; No man putteth a piece
of a new garment upon an old; if
otherwise, then both the new mak- eth a rent, and the piece that was
taken out of the new a agreeth not
with the old.
37 And no man putteth new wine
into old bottles; else the new wine
will burst the a bottles, and be
spilled, and the bottles shall perish.
38 But new wine must be put into
new bottles; and both are preserved.
39 No man also having drunk old
wine a straightway desireth new: for
he saith, The old is better.
Chapter 6
Jesus heals on the Sabbath—He chooses
the Twelve Apostles—He pronounces
blessings upon the obedient and woes
upon the wicked.
And it came to pass on the second
sabbath after the first, that he went
through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and
did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
2 And certain of the Pharisees said
unto them, Why do ye that which
is not lawful to do on the a sabbath
days?
3 And Jesus answering them said,
Have ye not read so much as this,
what David did, when himself was
an hungred, and they which were
with him;
4 How he went into the house of
God, and did take and eat the a shew- bread, and gave also to them that
were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
5 And he said unto them, That
the Son of man is Lord also of the
a sabbath.
6 And it came to pass also on an- other sabbath, that he entered into
the synagogue and taught: and there
was a man whose right hand was
withered.
7 And the scribes and Pharisees
watched him, whether he would heal
on the sabbath day; that they might
find an accusation against him.
8 But he a knew their thoughts,
and said to the man which had the
withered hand, Rise up, and stand
forth in the midst. And he arose
and stood forth.

10 And looking round about upon
them all, he said unto the man,
Stretch forth thy hand. And he did
so: and his hand was restored whole
as the other.
11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with an- other what they might do to Jesus.
12 And it came to pass in those
days, that he a went out into a mountain to b pray, and continued all night
in prayer to God.
13 ¶ And when it was day, he called
unto him his disciples: and of them
he a chose b twelve, whom also he
named c apostles;
14 Simon, (whom he also named a Peter,) and Andrew his brother,
James and John, Philip and Bar- tholomew,
15 Matthew and Thomas, James the
son of Alphæus, and Simon called
Zelotes,
16 And Judas the brother of James,
and Judas a Iscariot, which also was
the traitor.
17 ¶ And he came down with
them, and stood in the plain, and
the company of his disciples, and a
great multitude of people out of all
Judæa and Jerusalem, and from the
sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which
came to hear him, and to be healed
of their diseases;
18 And they that were vexed with a unclean spirits: and they were
healed.
19 And the whole multitude sought
to touch him: for there went a virtue
out of him, and b healed them all.
20 ¶ And he lifted up his eyes on
his disciples, and said, Blessed be
ye a poor: for yours is the b kingdom
of God.
21 Blessed are ye that a hunger now:
for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye
that weep now: for ye shall b laugh.
22 Blessed are ye, when men shall a hate you, and when they shall
b separate you from their company,
and shall c reproach you, and d cast
out your name as evil, for the Son
of man’s sake.
23 a Rejoice ye in that day, and
leap for b joy: for, behold, your c reward is great in heaven: for in the
like manner did their fathers unto
the prophets.
24 But woe unto you that are a rich! for ye have b received your
consolation.
25 Woe unto you that are full! for
ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that
laugh now! for ye shall mourn and
weep.
26 Woe unto you, when all a men
shall speak b well of you! for so did
their fathers to the false prophets.
27 ¶ But I say unto you which
hear, a Love your enemies, do good
to them which hate you,
28 Bless them that curse you, and a pray for them which despitefully
use you.
29 a And unto him that b smiteth
thee on the one cheek offer also the
other; and him that c taketh away
thy cloak forbid not to take thy

away thy goods ask them not again.

31 And as ye would that men
should do to you, do ye also to them
likewise.
32 For if ye love them which love
you, what thank have ye? for sin- ners also love those that love them.
33 And if ye do good to them which
do good to you, what thank have
ye? for sinners also do even the
same.
34 And if ye lend to them of whom
ye hope to receive, what thank have
ye? for sinners also lend to sinners,
to receive as much again.
35 But a love ye your enemies, and
do good, and b lend, hoping for noth- ing again; and your c reward shall be
great, and ye shall be the d children
of the Highest: for he is kind unto
the e unthankful and to the evil.
36 Be ye therefore a merciful, as
your Father also is b merciful.
37 a Judge not, and ye shall not be
judged: b condemn not, and ye shall
not be condemned: forgive, and ye
shall be c forgiven:
38 a Give, and it shall be given unto
you; good measure, pressed down,
and shaken together, and running
over, shall men give into your bosom.
For with the same b measure that ye
mete withal it shall be measured to
you again.
39 And he spake a parable unto
them, Can the a blind b lead the
blind? shall they not both fall into
the c ditch?
40 The disciple is not above his
master: but every one a that is per- fect shall be as his master.
41 And why beholdest thou the a mote that is in thy brother’s eye,
but perceivest not the beam that is
in thine own eye?
42 Either how canst thou say to
thy brother, Brother, let me pull
out the mote that is in thine eye,
when thou thyself beholdest not the
beam that is in thine own eye? Thou
hypocrite, cast out first the beam
out of thine own eye, and then shalt
thou see clearly to pull out the mote
that is in thy brother’s eye.
43 For a good tree bringeth not
forth corrupt a fruit; neither doth a
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
44 For every tree is known by his
own a fruit. For of thorns men do
not gather figs, nor of a bramble
bush gather they grapes.
45 A good man out of the good
treasure of his a heart bringeth forth
that which is good; and an evil man
out of the evil treasure of his heart
bringeth forth that which is evil:
for of the abundance of the b heart
his c mouth d speaketh.

is like:

Chapter 7
Jesus heals the centurion’s servant—
Jesus raises from death the son of the
widow of Nain—He praises John the
Baptist as more than a prophet—A
woman anoints Jesus’ feet, and He
forgives her sins.
Now when he had ended all his say- ings in the audience of the people,
he entered into Capernaum.
2 And a certain centurion’s servant,
who was dear unto him, was sick,
and ready to die.
3 And when he heard of Jesus, he
sent unto him the elders of the Jews,
beseeching him that he would come
and heal his servant.
4 And when they came to Jesus,
they besought him a instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom
he should do this:
5 For he loveth our nation, and he
hath built us a synagogue.
6 Then Jesus went with them. And
when he was now not far from the
house, the centurion sent friends to
him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble
not thyself: for I am not worthy that
thou shouldest enter under my roof:
7 Wherefore neither thought I
myself worthy to come unto thee:
but say in a word, and my servant
shall be healed.
8 For I also am a man set under
authority, having under me soldiers,
and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, Do this,
and he doeth it.
9 When Jesus heard these things,
he marvelled at him, and turned
him about, and said unto the people
that followed him, I say unto you,
I have not found so great faith, no,
not in a Israel.
10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant
whole that had been sick.
11 ¶ And it came to pass the day
after, that he went into a city called
Nain; and many of his disciples went
with him, and much people.
12 Now when he came nigh to the
gate of the city, behold, there was a
dead man carried out, the only son
of his mother, and she was a widow:
and much people of the city was
with her.
13 And when the Lord saw her, he
had a compassion on her, and said
unto her, Weep not.
14 And he came and touched the
bier: and they that bare him stood
still. And he said, Young man, I say
unto thee, Arise.
15 And he that was a dead sat up,
and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
16 And there came a a fear on all:
and they glorified God, saying, That
a great prophet is risen up among
us; and, That God hath b visited his
people.
17 And this rumour of him went
forth throughout all Judæa, and
throughout all the region round about.
18 And the disciples of a John
shewed him of all these things.
19 ¶ And John calling unto him two
of his disciples sent them to Jesus,
saying, Art thou he that should
come? or look we for another?
20 When the men were come unto
him, they said, John Baptist hath
sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou
he that should come? or look we for
another?
21 And in that same hour he a cured many of their infirmities and
plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto
many that were blind he gave b sight.
22 Then Jesus answering said unto
them, Go your way, and tell John
what things ye have seen and heard;
how that the blind see, the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, the

24 ¶ And when the messengers of
John were departed, he began to
speak unto the people concerning
John, What went ye out into the wil- derness for to see? A reed shaken
with the wind?
25 But what went ye out for to
see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
Behold, they which are gorgeously
a apparelled, and live delicately, are
in kings’ courts.
26 But what went ye out for to see?
A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and
much more than a prophet.
27 This is he, of whom it is written,
Behold, I send my a messenger before thy face, which shall prepare
thy way before thee.
28 For I say unto you, Among those
that are born of women there is not
a greater prophet than John the
Baptist: but he that is a least in the
kingdom of God is greater than he.
29 And all the people that heard
him, and the a publicans, justified
God, being baptized with the b bap- tism of John.
30 But the Pharisees and lawyers a rejected the counsel of God b against
themselves, being not c baptized of
him.
31 ¶ And the Lord said, Where- unto then shall I liken the men of
this generation? and to what are
they like?
32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We
have piped unto you, and ye have
not danced; we have a mourned to
you, and ye have not wept.
33 For John the Baptist came nei- ther eating bread nor drinking wine;
and ye say, He hath a devil.
34 The Son of man is come eating
and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
gluttonous man, and a winebibber,
a friend of publicans and sinners!
35 But wisdom is justified of all
her children.
36 ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.
37 And, behold, a a woman in the
city, which was a sinner, when she
knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster b box of ointment,
38 And stood at his feet behind him
weeping, and began to wash his feet
with tears, and did wipe them with
the hairs of her head, and kissed
his feet, and a anointed them with
the ointment.
39 Now when the Pharisee which
had bidden him saw it, he spake
within himself, saying, This man,
if he were a prophet, would have
known who and what manner of
woman this is that toucheth him:
for she is a sinner.
40 And Jesus answering said unto
him, Simon, I have somewhat to
say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.
41 There was a certain creditor
which had two debtors: the one
owed five hundred a pence, and the
other fifty.
42 And when they had nothing to
pay, he frankly a forgave them both. b Tell me therefore, which of them
will love him most?
43 Simon answered and said, I sup- pose that he, to whom he forgave
most. And he said unto him, Thou
hast rightly judged.
44 And he turned to the woman,
and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
woman? I entered into thine house,
thou gavest me no water for my feet:

him began to say within themselves,
Who is this that a forgiveth sins also?

Chapter 8
Jesus gives and interprets the parable of
the sower—He stills the tempest; casts
out a legion of devils, who then enter the
swine; heals a woman of an issue of blood;
and raises Jairus’s daughter from death.
And it came to pass afterward, that
he went throughout every a city and
village, preaching and shewing the
glad b tidings of the kingdom of God: c and the twelve were with him,
2 And certain women, which had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, a Mary called Magdalene,
out of whom went seven devils,
3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza
Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and
many others, which ministered unto
him of their substance.
4 ¶ And when much people were
gathered together, and were come
to him out of every city, he spake
by a parable:
5 A sower went out to sow his seed:
and as he sowed, some fell by the
way side; and it was trodden down,
and the fowls of the air devoured it.
6 And some fell upon a rock; and as
soon as it was sprung up, it withered
away, because it lacked moisture.
7 And some fell among thorns; and
the thorns sprang up with it, and
choked it.
8 And other fell on good ground,
and sprang up, and bare fruit an
hundredfold. And when he had said
these things, he cried, He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear.
9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
10 And he said, Unto you it is
given to know the a mysteries of the
kingdom of God: but to others in
b parables; that seeing they might
not see, and hearing they might not
c understand.
11 Now the parable is this: The a seed is the word of God.
12 Those by the way side are they
that hear; then cometh the devil,
and taketh away the word out of
their hearts, lest they should believe
and be saved.
13 They on the rock are they, which,
when they hear, receive the word
with joy; and these have no root,
which for a while believe, and in
time of a temptation fall away.
14 And that which fell among
thorns are they, which, when they
have heard, go forth, and are a choked
with b cares and c riches and d pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit
to e perfection.
15 But that on the good ground
are they, which in an a honest and
good b heart, having heard the word,
keep it, and bring forth c fruit with
patience.

19 ¶ Then came to him his mother
and his a brethren, and could not
come at him for the b press.
20 And it was told him by certain
which said, Thy mother and thy
brethren stand without, desiring
to see thee.
21 And he answered and said unto
them, My a mother and my brethren
are these which hear the word of
God, and b do it.
22 ¶ Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
with his disciples: and he said unto
them, Let us go over unto the other
side of the lake. And they launched
forth.
23 But as they sailed he fell asleep:
and there came down a storm
of wind on the lake; a and they
were filled with water, and were in
jeopardy.
24 And they came to him, and
awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and
rebuked the wind and the raging
of the water: and they ceased, and
there was a calm.
25 And he said unto them, Where
is your faith? And they being afraid
wondered, saying one to another,
What manner of man is this! for he
commandeth even the a winds and
water, and they obey him.
26 ¶ And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is a over
against Galilee.
27 And when he went forth to
land, there met him out of the city a
certain man, which had devils long
time, and ware no clothes, neither
abode in any house, but in the tombs.
28 When he saw Jesus, he cried
out, and fell down before him, and
with a loud voice said, What have
I to do with thee, a Jesus, thou Son
of God most high? I beseech thee,
torment me not.
29 (For he had commanded the
unclean spirit to come out of the
man. For oftentimes it had caught
him: and he was kept bound with
chains and in fetters; and he brake
the bands, and was driven of the
devil into the wilderness.)
30 And Jesus asked him, saying,
What is thy name? And he said,
a Legion: because many devils were
entered into him.
31 And they besought him that he
would not command them to go out
into the a deep.
32 And there was there an herd of
many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that
he would suffer them to enter into
them. And he suffered them.
33 Then went the devils out of the
man, and entered into the swine:
and the herd ran violently down a
steep place into the lake, and were
choked.
34 When they that fed them saw
what was done, they fled, and went
and told it in the city and in the
country.
35 Then they went out to see what
was done; and came to Jesus, and
found the man, out of whom the
devils were departed, sitting at the
feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his
right mind: and they were afraid.

by what means he that was possessed
of the devils was healed.
37 ¶ Then the whole multitude of
the country of the Gadarenes round
about besought him to depart from
them; for they were taken with great
fear: and he went up into the ship,
and returned back again.
38 Now the man out of whom the
devils were departed besought him
that he might be with him: but Jesus
sent him away, saying,
39 Return to thine own house, and
shew how great things God hath
done unto thee. And he went his
way, and a published throughout the
whole city how great things Jesus
had done unto him.
40 And it came to pass, that, when
Jesus was returned, the people gladly
received him: for they were all waiting for him.
41 ¶ And, behold, there came a man
named a Jairus, and he was a ruler of
the synagogue: and he fell down at
Jesus’ feet, and besought him that
he would come into his house:
42 For he had one only daughter,
about twelve years of age, and she
lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
43 ¶ And a woman having an issue
of a blood twelve years, which had
spent all her living upon physicians,
neither could be healed of any,
44 Came behind him, and touched
the a border of his garment: and
immediately her issue of blood
b stanched.
45 And Jesus said, Who touched
me? When all denied, Peter and
they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and
press thee, and sayest thou, Who
touched me?
46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath
touched me: for I perceive that a vir- tue is gone out of me.
47 And when the woman saw that
she was not hid, she came trembling,
and falling down before him, she
declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched
him, and how she was a healed immediately.
48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good a comfort: thy faith
hath made thee whole; go in peace.
49 ¶ While he yet spake, there
cometh one from the ruler of the
synagogue’s house, saying to him,
Thy daughter is dead; trouble not
the Master.
50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe
only, and she shall be made whole.
51 And when he came into the
house, he suffered no man to go
in, save Peter, and James, and John,
and the father and the mother of
the a maiden.
52 And all wept, and bewailed
her: but he said, Weep not; she is
not dead, but sleepeth.
53 And they a laughed him to scorn,
knowing that she was dead.
54 And he put them all out, and
took her by the hand, and called,
saying, Maid, arise.
55 And her spirit came again, and
she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that
they should tell no man what was
done.

2 And he sent them to a preach
the kingdom of God, and to b heal
the sick.
3 And he said unto them, Take
nothing for your journey, neither
staves, nor scrip, neither bread,
neither money; neither have two
coats apiece.
4 And whatsoever house ye enter
into, there abide, and thence depart.
5 And whosoever will not receive
you, when ye go out of that city,
a shake off the very b dust from
your feet for a testimony against
them.
6 And they departed, and went
through the towns, preaching the
a gospel, and healing every where.
7 ¶ Now a Herod the tetrarch heard
of all that was done by him: and he
was perplexed, because that it was
said of some, that John was risen
from the dead;
8 And of some, that Elias had ap- peared; and of others, that one of
the old prophets was risen again.
9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I
hear such things? And he desired
to see him.
10 ¶ And the apostles, when they
were returned, told a him all that
they had done. And he took them,
and went aside privately into a
b desert place belonging to the city
called Bethsaida.
11 And the people, when they knew
it, followed him: and he received
them, and spake unto them of the
kingdom of God, and healed them
that had need of healing.
12 And when the day began to
wear away, then came the twelve,
and said unto him, Send the mul- titude away, that they may go into
the towns and country round about,
and lodge, and get victuals: for we
are here in a desert place.
13 But he said unto them, Give
ye them to eat. And they said, We
have no more but five loaves and
two fishes; except we should go and
buy meat for all this people.
14 For they were about a five thousand men. And he said to his disci- ples, Make them sit down by fifties
in a company.
15 And they did so, and made them
all sit down.
16 Then he took the five loaves
and the two fishes, and looking up
to heaven, he blessed them, and
brake, and gave to the disciples to
set before the multitude.
17 And they did eat, and were all
filled: and there was taken up of
fragments that remained to them
twelve baskets.
18 ¶ And it came to pass, as he was
alone praying, his disciples were
with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
19 They answering said, John the
Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets
is risen again.
20 He said unto them, But whom
say ye that I am? Peter answering
said, The a Christ of God.
21 And he straitly charged them,
and commanded them to a tell no
man that thing;
22 Saying, The Son of man must
suffer many things, and be a rejected
of the elders and chief priests and
scribes, and be slain, and be raised
the third day.
23 ¶ And he said to them all, If any
man will come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his a cross
daily, and b follow me.

shall save it.

26 For whosoever shall be a ashamed
of me and of my words, of him
shall the b Son of man be ashamed, c when he shall come in his own
glory, and in his Father’s, and of the
holy angels.
27 But I tell you of a truth, there
be some standing here, which shall
not taste of a death, till they see the
kingdom of God.
28 ¶ And it came to pass about an a eight days after these sayings, he
took Peter and John and James, and
went up into a b mountain to c pray.
29 And as he prayed, the fashion
of his countenance was a altered,
and his raiment was white and b glistering.
30 And, behold, there talked with
him two men, which were Moses
and Elias:
31 Who appeared in glory, a and
spake of his b decease which he
should accomplish at Jerusalem.
32 But Peter and they that were
with him were heavy with sleep:
and when they were awake, they
saw his a glory, and the two men
that stood with him.
33 And it came to pass, as they
departed from him, Peter said unto
Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be
here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing
what he said.
34 While he thus spake, there came
a cloud, and overshadowed them:
and they feared as they entered
into the cloud.
35 And there came a voice out of
the cloud, saying, This is my a beloved Son: hear him.
36 And when the voice was past,
Jesus was found alone. And they
kept it close, and told no man in
those days any of those things which
they had seen.
37 ¶ And it came to pass, that on
the next day, when they were come
down from the hill, much people
met him.
38 And, behold, a man of the com- pany cried out, saying, Master, I be- seech thee, look upon my son: for
he is mine only child.
39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him,
and he suddenly crieth out; and it
teareth him that he foameth again,
and bruising him hardly departeth
from him.
40 And I besought thy disciples to
cast him out; and they could not.
41 And Jesus answering said, O
faithless and perverse generation,
how long shall I be with you, and
suffer you? Bring thy son hither.
42 And as he was yet a coming,
the devil threw him down, and tare
him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean
spirit, and healed the child, and
delivered him again to his father.
43 ¶ And they were all amazed
at the a mighty power of God. But
while they wondered every one at
all things which Jesus did, he said
unto his disciples,
44 Let these sayings sink down into
your ears: for the Son of man shall
be a delivered into the hands of men.
45 But they a understood not this
saying, and it was hid from them,

that they perceived it not: and they
feared to ask him of that saying.
46 ¶ Then there arose a reasoning
among them, which of them should
be a greatest.
47 And Jesus, perceiving the
thought of their heart, took a child,
and set him by him,
48 And said unto them, Whosoever
shall receive this child in my a name
receiveth me: and whosoever shall
b receive me receiveth him that sent
me: for he that is least among you
all, the same shall be c great.
49 ¶ And John answered and said,
Master, we saw one casting out dev- ils in thy name; and we forbad him,
because he followeth not with us.
50 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid
him not: for he that is not against
us is a for us.
51 ¶ And it came to pass, when
the time was come that he should
be received up, he steadfastly set
his face to go to Jerusalem,
52 And sent messengers before his
face: and they went, and entered
into a village of the a Samaritans,
to make ready for him.
53 And they did not receive him,
because his face was as though he
would go to Jerusalem.
54 And when his disciples a James
and John saw this, they said, Lord,
wilt thou that we command b fire
to come down from heaven, and
consume them, even as Elias did?
55 But he turned, and rebuked
them, and said, Ye know not what
manner of a spirit ye are of.
56 For the a Son of man is not
come to b destroy men’s c lives, but
to d save them. And they went to another village.
57 ¶ And it came to pass, that, as
they went in the way, a certain man
said unto him, Lord, I will a follow
thee whithersoever thou goest.
58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes
have holes, and birds of the air have
nests; but the Son of man hath not
where to lay his head.
59 And he said unto another, a Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer
me first to go and bury my father.
60 Jesus said unto him, Let the
dead bury their dead: but go thou
and preach the kingdom of God.
61 And another also said, Lord, I
will a follow thee; but let me first
go bid them farewell, which are at
home at my house.
62 And Jesus said unto him, No
man, having put his hand to the
a plough, and b looking back, is fit
for the kingdom of God.

the way.
5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, a Peace be to this house.
6 And if the son of peace be there,
your peace shall rest upon it: if not,
it shall turn to you again.
7 And in the same house remain,
eating and drinking such things as
they give: for the a labourer is wor- thy of his b hire. Go not from house
to house.
8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they a receive you, eat such
things as are set before you:
9 And heal the sick that are therein,
and say unto them, The a kingdom
of God is come nigh unto you.
10 But into whatsoever city ye
enter, and they receive you not, go
your ways out into the streets of the
same, and say,
11 Even the very a dust of your city,
which cleaveth on us, we do wipe
off against you: notwithstanding be
ye sure of this, that the kingdom of
God is come nigh unto you.
12 But I say unto you, that it shall
be more tolerable in that day for
Sodom, than for that city.
13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe
unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
mighty works had been done in
Tyre and Sidon, which have been
done in you, they had a great while
ago repented, sitting in sackcloth
and ashes.
14 But it shall be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment,
than for you.
15 And thou, Capernaum, which
art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust
down to hell.
16 a He that b heareth you heareth
me; and he that c despiseth you d despiseth me; and he that e despiseth
me despiseth him that sent me.
17 ¶ And the a seventy returned
again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
devils are subject unto us through
thy name.
18 And he said unto them, I beheld a Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
19 Behold, I give unto you a power
to b tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the
enemy: and nothing shall by any
means c hurt you.
20 Notwithstanding in this a rejoice
not, that the spirits are subject unto
you; but rather b rejoice, because
your names are c written in heaven.
21 ¶ In that hour Jesus a rejoiced
in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,

disciples, and said privately, Blessed
are the a eyes which see the things
that ye see:
24 For I tell you, that many a prophets and b kings have desired to see
those things which ye see, and have
not seen them; and to hear those
things which ye hear, and have not
heard them.
25 ¶ And, behold, a certain lawyer
stood up, and tempted him, saying,
Master, what shall I do to inherit
a eternal life?
26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
27 And he answering said, Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy a heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy strength, and with all thy
mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
28 And he said unto him, Thou
hast answered right: this do, and
thou shalt a live.
29 But he, willing to a justify him- self, said unto Jesus, And who is my
b neighbour?
30 And Jesus answering said, A cer- tain man went down from Jerusalem
to Jericho, and fell among thieves,
which stripped him of his raiment,
and a wounded him, and departed,
leaving him half dead.
31 And by chance there came down
a certain priest that way: and when
he saw him, he passed by on the
other side.
32 And likewise a Levite, when he
was at the place, came and looked on
him, and passed by on the other side.
33 But a certain a Samaritan, as he
journeyed, came where he was: and
when he saw him, he had b compassion on him,
34 And went to him, and bound
up his wounds, pouring in oil and
wine, and set him on his own beast,
and brought him to an inn, and took
a care of him.
35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
gave them to the a host, and said unto
him, Take care of him; and what- soever thou spendest more, when I
come again, I will repay thee.
36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him
that fell among the thieves?
37 And he said, He that shewed
mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
him, Go, and do thou likewise.
38 ¶ Now it came to pass, as they
went, that he entered into a certain
village: and a certain woman named
a Martha received him into her house.
39 And she had a sister called
Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet,
and heard his word.
40 But Martha was cumbered about
much serving, and came to him, and
said, Lord, dost thou not care that my
sister hath left me to serve alone?
bid her therefore that she help me.
41 And Jesus answered and said
unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
a careful and troubled about many
things:
42 But one thing is needful: and
Mary hath a chosen that good part,
which shall not be taken away
from her.
Chapter 11
Jesus gives the Lord’s Prayer—He discusses the casting out of devils—He acclaims Himself as greater than Jonah
and Solomon—He rebukes the Pharisees
and says that the blood of all the prophets may be required of their generation.
And it came to pass, that, as he was
praying in a certain place, when
he ceased, one of his disciples said
unto him, Lord, a teach us to b pray,
as John also taught his disciples.

3 Give us day by day our daily
bread.
4 And a forgive us our sins; for we
also forgive every one that is b indebted to us. c And lead us not into
temptation; but deliver us from
evil.
5 a And he said unto them, Which of
you shall have a friend, and shall go
unto him at midnight, and say unto
him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
6 For a friend of mine in his jour- ney is come to me, and I have noth- ing to set before him?
7 And he from within shall answer
and say, Trouble me not: the door
is now shut, and my children are
with me in bed; I cannot rise and
give thee.
8 I say unto you, Though he will
not rise and give him, because he
is his a friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him
as many as he needeth.
9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it
shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you.
10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
and to him that knocketh it shall
be opened.
11 If a son shall ask bread of any
of you that is a father, will he give
him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will
he for a fish give him a serpent?
12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will
he offer him a scorpion?
13 If ye then, being evil, know how
to give good gifts unto your children:
how much more shall your heavenly
Father give a the Holy Spirit to them
that ask him?
14 ¶ And he was casting a out a
devil, and it was dumb. And it came
to pass, when the devil was gone
out, the dumb spake; and the peo- ple wondered.
15 But some of them said, He
casteth out devils through a Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
16 And others, tempting him,
sought of him a a sign from heaven.
17 But he, knowing their a thoughts,
said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought
to desolation; and a house divided
against a house falleth.
18 If Satan also be divided against
himself, how shall his kingdom
stand? because ye say that I cast out
devils through Beelzebub.
19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out
devils, by whom do your sons a cast
them out? therefore shall they be
your judges.
20 But if I with the a finger of God
cast out devils, no doubt the king- dom of God is come upon you.
21 When a strong man armed
keepeth his palace, his goods are
in peace:
22 But when a stronger than he
shall come upon him, and over- come him, he taketh from him all
his armour wherein he trusted, and
divideth his spoils.
23 He that is not with me is a against
me: and he that gathereth not with
me scattereth.

26 Then goeth he, and taketh to

27 ¶ And it came to pass, as he
spake these things, a certain woman
of the company lifted up her voice,
and said unto him, a Blessed is the
womb that bare thee, and the paps
which thou hast sucked.
28 But he said, Yea rather, a blessed
are they that hear the word of God,
and b keep it.
29 ¶ And when the people were
gathered thick together, he began
to say, This is an evil generation:
they seek a a sign; and there shall
no sign be given it, but the sign of
Jonas the prophet.
30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the
Ninevites, so shall also the Son of
man be to this generation.
31 The a queen of the south shall
rise up in the judgment with the
men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the
utmost parts of the earth to hear the
wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a
greater than Solomon is here.
32 The men of Nineve shall rise
up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for
they repented at the preaching of
Jonas; and, behold, a greater than
Jonas is here.
33 No man, when he hath lighted a a candle, putteth it in a secret place,
neither under a bushel, but on a
candlestick, that they which come
in may see the light.
34 The light of the body is the a eye:
therefore when thine eye is b single,
thy whole body also is full of light;
but when thine eye is evil, thy body
also is full of c darkness.
35 Take heed therefore that the
light which is in thee be not dark- ness.
36 If thy whole body therefore be
full of light, having no part dark,
the whole shall be full of light, as
when the bright shining of a candle
doth give thee light.
37 ¶ And as he spake, a certain
Pharisee besought him to dine with
him: and he went in, and sat down
to meat.
38 And when the Pharisee saw it,
he marvelled that he had not first
washed before dinner.
39 And the Lord said unto him,
Now do ye Pharisees make a clean
the outside of the cup and the plat- ter; but your b inward part is full of c ravening and d wickedness.
40 Ye fools, did not he that made
that which is without make that
which is within also?
41 a But rather b give c alms of such
things as ye have; and, behold, all
things are d clean unto you.

44 Woe unto you, a scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
b graves which appear not, and the
men that walk over them are not
aware of them.
45 ¶ Then answered one of the
lawyers, and said unto him, Mas- ter, thus saying thou a reproachest
us also.
46 And he said, Woe unto you also,
ye a lawyers! for ye lade men with
burdens grievous to be borne, and
ye yourselves touch not the burdens
with one of your fingers.
47 Woe unto you! for ye build the
sepulchres of the prophets, and your
fathers killed them.
48 Truly ye bear witness that ye a allow the deeds of your fathers:
for they indeed killed them, and
ye build their sepulchres.
49 Therefore also said the wisdom
of God, I will send them prophets
and apostles, and some of them they
shall slay and persecute:
50 That the a blood of all the proph- ets, which was b shed from the foundation of the world, may be required
of this generation;
51 From the blood of Abel unto the
blood of Zacharias, which perished
between the altar and the a temple:
verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
52 Woe unto you, a lawyers! for ye
have taken away the b key of c knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves,
and them that were entering in ye
d hindered.
53 And as he said these things unto
them, the scribes and the Pharisees
began to a urge him vehemently, and
to b provoke him to speak of many
things:
54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to a catch something out of his
mouth, that they might accuse him.
Chapter 12
Jesus teaches, Beware of hypocrisy;
lay up treasures in heaven rather than
on earth; prepare for the coming of the
Lord; where much is given, much is
required; preaching the gospel causes
division.
In the mean time, when there were
gathered together an innumerable
multitude of people, insomuch that
they trode one upon another, he
began to say unto his disciples first
of all, Beware ye of the a leaven of
the Pharisees, which is b hypocrisy.
2 For there is nothing covered, that
shall not be revealed; neither a hid,
that shall not be known.
3 Therefore whatsoever ye have
spoken in a darkness shall be heard
in the light; and that which ye have
b spoken in the ear in c closets shall
be proclaimed upon the housetops.
4 And I say unto you my a friends,
Be not b afraid of them that kill the
body, and after that have no more
that they can do.
5 But I will forewarn you whom ye
shall a fear: Fear him, which after he
hath killed hath power to cast into
b hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

shall a confess me before men, him
shall the Son of man also confess
before the b angels of God:
9 a But he that denieth me before
men shall be denied before the an- gels of God.
10 And whosoever shall speak a
word against the Son of man, it shall
be forgiven him: but unto him that
a blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost
it shall not be forgiven.
11 And when they bring you unto
the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and a powers, b take ye no
thought how or what thing ye shall
answer, or what ye shall c say:
12 For the a Holy Ghost shall b teach
you in the same hour what ye ought
to say.
13 ¶ And one of the company
said unto him, Master, speak to my
brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
14 And he said unto him, Man,
who made me a judge or a divider
over you?
15 And he said unto them, Take
heed, and beware of a covetousness:
for a man’s life consisteth not in the
abundance of the things which he
possesseth.
16 And he spake a parable unto
them, saying, The ground of a
certain rich man brought forth
plentifully:
17 And he thought within himself,
saying, What shall I do, because I
have no room where to a bestow my
fruits?
18 And he said, This will I do: I
will pull down my barns, and build
greater; and there will I bestow all
my fruits and my goods.
19 And I will say to my soul, a Soul,
thou hast much goods laid up for
many years; take thine ease, b eat,
drink, and be merry.
20 But God said unto him, Thou
fool, this night thy a soul shall be
required of thee: then whose shall
those things be, which thou hast
provided?
21 So is he that layeth up a treasure for b himself, and is not rich
toward God.
22 ¶ And he said unto his disciples,
Therefore I say unto you, a Take no b thought for your life, what ye shall
eat; neither for the body, what ye
shall put on.
23 The life is more than meat, and
the body is more than raiment.
24 Consider the a ravens: for they
neither sow nor reap; which neither
have storehouse nor barn; and God
feedeth them: how much more are
ye better than the fowls?
25 And which of you with taking
thought can add to his stature one
cubit?
26 If ye then be not able to do that
thing which is least, why take ye
thought for the rest?
27 Consider the a lilies how they
grow: they toil not, they spin not;
and yet I say unto you, that Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like
one of these.
28 If then God so clothe the grass,
which is to day in the field, and to
morrow is cast into the oven; a how
much more will he clothe you, O ye
of little faith?

29 And seek not ye what ye shall

30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and
your Father knoweth that ye have
need of these things.
31 ¶ a But rather seek ye the b kingdom of God; and c all these things
shall be added unto you.
32 Fear not, little a flock; for it is
your Father’s good pleasure to give
you the b kingdom.
33 Sell that ye have, and give a alms;
provide yourselves bags which wax
not old, a b treasure in the heavens
that c faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
34 For where your a treasure is,
there will your heart be also.
35 Let your loins be girded about,
and your a lights burning;
36 And ye yourselves like unto men
that wait for their lord, when he
will return from the wedding; that
when he cometh and knocketh, they
may open unto him immediately.
37 a Blessed are those servants,
whom the lord when he cometh
shall find bwatching: verily I say
unto you, that he shall gird himself,
and make them to sit down to meat,
and will come forth and serve them.
38 And if he shall come in the
second watch, or come in the third
watch, and find them so, blessed are
those servants.
39 And this know, that if the a goodman of the house had known what
hour the thief would come, he would
have watched, and not have b suffered
his house to be broken through.
40 Be ye therefore ready also: for
the Son of man a cometh at an b hour
when ye think not.
41 ¶ Then Peter said unto him,
Lord, speakest thou this parable
unto us, or even to all?
42 And the Lord said, Who then
is that a faithful and wise b steward,
whom his lord shall make ruler over
his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?
43 Blessed is that servant, whom
his lord when he cometh shall find
so a doing.
44 Of a truth I say unto you, that
he will make him a ruler over b all
that he hath.
45 But and if that servant say in his
heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
and shall begin to beat the menservants and a maidens, and to eat
and drink, and to be drunken;
46 The lord of that servant will
come in a day when he looketh not
for him, and at an hour when he is
not aware, and will cut him in sun- der, and will appoint him his a portion with the unbelievers.
47 And that a servant, which knew
his lord’s b will, and c prepared not
himself, neither did according to
his will, shall be beaten with many
stripes.
48 But he that a knew not, and did
commit things worthy of stripes,
shall be b beaten with few stripes. For

earth; and what will I, if it be al- ready kindled?
50 But I have a a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I b straitened
till it be accomplished!
51 Suppose ye that I am come to
give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay;
but rather division:
52 For from henceforth there shall
be five in one house divided, three
against two, and two against three.
53 The father shall be divided
against the son, and the son a against
the father; the mother against the
daughter, and the daughter against
the mother; the mother in law
against her daughter in law, and
the daughter in law against her

54 ¶ And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of
the west, straightway ye say, There
cometh a shower; and so it is.
55 And when ye see the south wind
blow, ye say, There will be heat; and
it cometh to pass.
56 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern
the face of the sky and of the earth;
but how is it that ye do not discern
this time?
57 Yea, and why even of yourselves
judge ye not what is right?
58 ¶ When thou goest with thine
adversary to the magistrate, as thou
art in the way, give diligence that
thou mayest be delivered from him;
lest he hale thee to the judge, and
the judge deliver thee to the officer,
and the officer cast thee into prison.
59 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart
thence, till thou hast paid the very
last a mite.
Chapter 13
Jesus teaches, Repent or perish—He
gives the parable of the barren fig tree,
heals a woman on the Sabbath, and
likens the kingdom of God to a mustard seed—He discusses whether few
or many are saved and laments over
Jerusalem.
There were present at that season
some that told him of the Galilæans,
whose blood Pilate had mingled
with their sacrifices.
2 And Jesus answering said unto
them, Suppose ye that these Gali- læans were a sinners above all the
Galilæans, because they suffered
such things?
3 I tell you, Nay: but, except
ye a repent, ye shall all likewise b perish.
4 Or those eighteen, upon whom
the tower in Siloam fell, and slew
them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in
Jerusalem?
5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye
repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
6 ¶ He spake also this parable; A
certain man had a fig tree planted
in his a vineyard; and he came and
sought fruit thereon, and found
none.
7 Then said he unto the dresser of
his vineyard, Behold, these three
years I come seeking fruit on this
fig tree, and find none: a cut it down;
why cumbereth it the ground?
8 And he answering said unto him,
Lord, let it alone this year also, till I
shall dig about it, and dung it:
9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if
not, then after that thou shalt cut
it down.
10 And he was teaching in one of
the synagogues on the sabbath.
11 ¶ And, behold, there was a
woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed
together, and could in no wise lift
up herself.
12 And when Jesus saw her, he
called her to him, and said unto her,

infirmity.
13 And he a laid his b hands on her:
and immediately she was made
straight, and glorified God.
14 And the ruler of the synagogue
answered with indignation, because
that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people,
There are six days in which men
ought to a work: in them therefore
come and be healed, and not on the
sabbath day.
15 The Lord then answered him,
and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
each one of you on the sabbath loose
his ox or his ass from the stall, and
lead him away to watering?
16 And ought not this woman, be- ing a daughter of Abraham, whom
Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen
years, be loosed from this bond on
the a sabbath day ?
17 And when he had said these
things, all his adversaries were
ashamed: and all the people rejoiced
for all the glorious things that were
done by him.
18 ¶ Then said he, Unto what is the
kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I a resemble it?
19 It is like a grain of mustard seed,
which a man took, and cast into his
garden; and it grew, and a waxed a
great tree; and the fowls of the air
lodged in the branches of it.
20 And again he said, Whereunto
shall I liken the kingdom of God?
21 It is like leaven, which a woman
took and hid in three measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened.
22 And he went through the cities
and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
23 Then said one unto him, Lord,
are there a few that be saved? And
he said unto them,
24 ¶ Strive to enter in at the a strait b gate: for many, I say unto you, will
c seek to enter in, and shall not be
able.
25 When once the master of the
house is risen up, and hath shut
to the door, and ye begin to stand
without, and to knock at the door,
saying, Lord, a Lord, open unto
us; and he shall answer and say
unto you, I know you not whence
ye are:
26 Then shall ye begin to say, We
have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our
streets.
27 But he shall say, I tell you,
I know you not whence ye are;
a depart from me, all ye workers of
iniquity.
28 There shall be a weeping and
gnashing of teeth, when ye shall
see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the
b kingdom of God, and you yourselves
thrust out.
29 And a they shall come from
the east, and from the west, and
from the north, and from the south,
and shall sit down in the kingdom
of God.
30 And, behold, there are last
which shall be first, and there are
a first which shall be last.

Chapter 14
Jesus again heals on the Sabbath—He
teaches humility and gives the parable
of the great supper—Those who follow
Him must forsake all else.
And it came to pass, as he went into
the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day,
that they watched him.
2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had
the dropsy.
3 And Jesus answering spake unto
the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
day ?
4 And they held their peace. And
he took him, and healed him, and
let him go;
5 And answered them, saying,
Which of you shall have an ass or
an ox fallen into a pit, and will not
straightway pull him out on the
a sabbath day ?
6 And they could not answer him
again to these things.
7 ¶ And he put forth a parable
to those which were bidden, when
he marked how they chose out the
a chief rooms; saying unto them,
8 When thou art a bidden of any
man to a wedding, sit not down in
the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden
of him;
9 And he that bade thee and him
come and say to thee, Give this man
place; and thou begin with shame
to take the lowest room.
10 But when thou art bidden, go
and sit down in the a lowest room;
that when he that bade thee cometh,
he may say unto thee, Friend, go up
b higher: then shalt thou have c worship in the presence of them that
sit at meat with thee.
11 For whosoever a exalteth himself shall be b abased; and he that c humbleth himself shall be exalted.
12 ¶ Then said he also to him that
bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends,
nor thy brethren, neither thy kins- men, nor thy rich neighbours; lest
they also bid thee again, and a rec- ompence be made thee.
13 But when thou makest a feast,
call the a poor, the maimed, the lame,
the blind:
14 And thou shalt be a blessed; for
they cannot recompense thee: for
thou shalt be b recompensed at the c resurrection of the just.

sat at meat with him heard these

things, he said unto him, Blessed
is he that shall a eat b bread in the
kingdom of God.
16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
bade many:
17 And sent his servant at supper
time to say to them that were bidden,
Come; for all things are now ready.
18 And they all with one consent
began to make a excuse. The first
said unto him, I have bought a
piece of ground, and I must needs
go and see it: I pray thee have me
excused.
19 And another said, I have bought
five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove
them: I pray thee have me excused.
20 And another said, I have mar- ried a wife, and therefore I cannot
come.
21 So that servant came, and
shewed his lord these things. Then
the master of the house being angry
said to his servant, Go out quickly
into the streets and lanes of the
city, and bring in hither the poor,
and the maimed, and the a halt, and
the blind.
22 And the servant said, Lord, it
is done as thou hast commanded,
and yet there is room.
23 And the a lord said unto the ser- vant, Go out into the highways and
b hedges, and c compel them to come
in, that my house may be filled.
24 For I say unto you, That a none
of those men which were bidden
shall taste of my supper.
25 ¶ And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
said unto them,
26 If any man come to me, and a hate not his father, and mother,
and wife, and children, and breth- ren, and sisters, b yea, and his own c life also, he cannot be my d disciple.
27 And whosoever doth not bear
his a cross, and come after me, cannot be my b disciple.
28 For which of you, intending to
build a tower, sitteth not down first,
and a counteth the b cost, whether he
have sufficient to c finish it?
29 Lest a haply, after he hath laid
the foundation, and is not able to
finish it, all that behold it begin to
mock him,
30 Saying, This man began to build,
and was not able to a finish.
31 Or what king, going to make
war against another king, sitteth not
down first, and a consulteth whether
he be able with ten thousand to
meet him that cometh against him
with twenty thousand?
32 Or else, while the other is yet
a great way off, he sendeth an a am- bassage, and desireth conditions of
peace.
33 So likewise, whosoever he be
of you that a forsaketh not all that
he hath, he cannot be my b disciple.

Chapter 15
Jesus gives the parables of the lost
sheep, the piece of silver, and the prodigal son.
Then drew near unto him all the a publicans and sinners for to hear
him.
2 And the Pharisees and scribes
murmured, saying, This man receiv- eth sinners, and eateth with them.
3 ¶ And he spake this parable unto
them, saying,
4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety and nine
a in the wilderness, and go after that
which is b lost, until he find it?
5 And when he hath found it, he
layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
6 And when he cometh home, he
calleth together his friends and
neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my
sheep which was lost.
7 I say unto you, that likewise a joy shall be in heaven over one
b sinner that c repenteth, more than
over ninety and nine just persons,
which need no repentance.
8 ¶ Either what woman having
ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
a piece, doth not light a candle, and
sweep the house, and seek diligently
till she find it?
9 And when she hath found it, she
calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with
me; for I have found the piece which
I had lost.
10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is
joy in the presence of the a angels of
God over one b sinner that repenteth.
11 ¶ And he said, A certain man
had two sons:
12 And the younger of them said
to his father, Father, give me the
portion of a goods that falleth to me.
And he divided unto them his living.
13 And not many days after the
younger son gathered all together,
and took his journey into a far country, and there a wasted his b substance
with c riotous living.
14 And when he had spent all,
there arose a mighty famine in that
land; and he began to be in want.
15 And he went and joined himself
to a citizen of that country; and he
sent him into his fields to feed swine.
16 And he a would fain have filled
his belly with the b husks that the
swine did eat: and no man gave
unto him.
17 And when he a came to himself,
he said, How many hired servants of
my father’s have bread enough and
to spare, and I perish with hunger!
18 I will a arise and go to my father,
and will say unto him, Father, I
have b sinned against heaven, and
before thee,
19 And am no more worthy to be
called thy son: make me as one of
thy hired servants.
20 And he arose, and came to his
father. But when he was yet a great
way off, his father saw him, and had
a compassion, and ran, and fell on
his neck, and kissed him.
21 And the son said unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven,
and in thy sight, and am no more
a worthy to be called thy b son.
22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and

put it on him; and put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet:
23 And bring hither the fatted
calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and
be merry:
24 For this my son was dead, and
is alive again; he was lost, and is
found. And they began to be merry.
25 Now his elder son was in the
field: and as he came and drew nigh
to the house, he heard musick and
dancing.
26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
meant.
27 And he said unto him, Thy
brother is come; and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf, because he
hath received him safe and sound.
28 And he was angry, and would
not go in: therefore came his father
out, and entreated him.
29 And he answering said to his
father, Lo, these many years do I
serve thee, neither transgressed
I at any time thy commandment:
and yet thou never gavest me a kid,
that I might make merry with my
friends:
30 But as soon as this thy son was
come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed
for him the fatted calf.
31 And he said unto him, a Son,
thou art ever with me, and b all that
I have is thine.
32 It was a meet that we should
make merry, and be glad: for this
thy brother was dead, and is alive
again; and was lost, and is found.
Chapter 16
Jesus gives the parable of the unjust
steward—He teaches of service and
condemns divorce—He gives the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.
And he said also unto his disci- ples, There was a certain rich man,
which had a steward; and the same
was accused unto him that he had
a wasted his goods.
2 And he called him, and said
unto him, How is it that I hear this
of thee? give an a account of thy b stewardship; for thou mayest be
no longer steward.
3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship:
I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
4 I am resolved what to do, that,
when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their
houses.
5 So he called every one of his lord’s
debtors unto him, and said unto the
first, How much owest thou unto
my lord?
6 And he said, An hundred mea- sures of oil. And he said unto him,
Take thy bill, and sit down quickly,
and write fifty.
7 Then said he to another, And how
much owest thou? And he said, An
hundred measures of wheat. And
he said unto him, Take thy bill, and
write fourscore.
8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
wisely: for the children of this world
are in their generation wiser than
the a children of b light.
9 And I say unto you, Make to your- selves friends of the a mammon of
unrighteousness; that, when ye fail,
they may receive you into everlast- ing habitations.
10 He that is a faithful in that which
is least is faithful also in much: and
he that is unjust in the least is un- just also in much.
11 If therefore ye have not been
faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your a trust
the true b riches?
12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s,
who shall give you that which is
your own?

13 ¶ No servant can serve two a masters: for either he will hate the
one, and love the other; or else he
will hold to the one, and despise
the other. Ye cannot serve God and
mammon.
14 And the Pharisees also, who
were a covetous, heard all these
things: and they derided him.
15 And he said unto them, Ye are
they which a justify yourselves be- fore men; but God b knoweth your c hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among d men is e abomination
in the sight of God.

17 And it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass, than one tittle of the
a law to fail.
18 Whosoever a putteth away his
wife, and marrieth another, com- mitteth adultery: and whosoever
marrieth her that is put away from
her husband committeth adultery.
19 ¶ There was a certain rich man,
which was clothed in purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously
every day:
20 And there was a certain a beggar
named Lazarus, which was laid at
his gate, full of sores,
21 And desiring to be fed with the
crumbs which fell from the rich
man’s table: moreover the dogs came
and licked his sores.
22 And it came to pass, that the
beggar died, and was carried by
the a angels into b Abraham’s bosom:
the rich man also died, and was
buried;
23 And in a hell he lift up his
eyes, being in torments, and seeth
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in
his bosom.
24 And he cried and said, Father
Abraham, have mercy on me, and
send Lazarus, that he may dip the
tip of his finger in water, and cool
my tongue; for I am tormented in
this flame.
25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
a receivedst thy good things, and
likewise Lazarus evil things: but
now he is comforted, and thou art
tormented.
26 And beside all this, between
us and you there is a great a gulf
fixed: so that they which would pass
from hence to you cannot; neither
can they pass to us, that would come
from thence.
27 Then he said, I pray thee there- fore, father, that thou wouldest send
him to my father’s house:
28 For I have five brethren; that
he may testify unto them, lest they
also come into this place of torment.
29 Abraham saith unto him, They
have a Moses and the prophets; let
them hear them.
30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
from the a dead, they will repent.
31 And he said unto him, If they a hear not Moses and the b prophets,
neither will they be c persuaded,
though one rose from the dead.

have done all those things which are

that which was our b duty to do.
11 ¶ And it came to pass, as he
went to Jerusalem, that he passed
through the midst of Samaria and
Galilee.
12 And as he entered into a certain
village, there met him ten men that
were a lepers, which stood afar off:
13 And they lifted up their voices,
and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy
on us.
14 And when he saw them, he said
unto them, Go shew yourselves unto
the a priests. And it came to pass, that,
as they went, they were cleansed.
15 And one of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned back,
and with a loud voice glorified God,
16 And fell down on his face at his
feet, giving him a thanks: and he was
a Samaritan.
17 And Jesus answering said, Were
there not ten a cleansed? but where
are the b nine?
18 There are not found that re- turned to give glory to God, save
this stranger.
19 And he said unto him, Arise,
go thy way: thy faith hath made
thee whole.
20 ¶ And when he was demanded
of the Pharisees, when the a kingdom
of God should come, he answered
them and said, The kingdom of God
cometh not with observation:
21 Neither shall they say, Lo here!
or, lo there! for, behold, the a kingdom of God b is c within you.
22 And he said unto the disciples,
The days will come, when ye shall
desire to see one of the days of the
Son of man, and ye shall not see it.
23 And they shall say to you, See
here; or, a see there: go not after them,
nor follow them.
24 For as the lightning, that light- eneth out of the one part under
heaven, shineth unto the other part
under heaven; so shall also the Son
of man be in his a day.

Chapter 18
Jesus gives the parables of the unjust
judge and the Pharisee and publican—
He invites little children to come unto
Him and teaches how to gain eternal
life—He tells of His coming death and
resurrection and gives sight to a blind
man.
And he spake a parable unto them
to this end, that men ought a always
to b pray, and not to c faint;
2 Saying, There was in a city a
judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:
3 And there was a widow in that
city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
4 And he would not for a while:
but afterward he said within him- self, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
5 Yet because this widow troubleth
me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she weary me.
6 And the Lord said, Hear what
the a unjust judge saith.
7 And shall not God a avenge his
own elect, which cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with
b them?
8 a I tell you that he will b avenge
them speedily. Nevertheless when
the Son of man cometh, shall he
find faith on the earth?
9 And he spake this parable unto
certain which a trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and b despised others:
10 Two men went up into the
temple to a pray; the one a Pharisee,
and the other a publican.
11 The Pharisee stood and prayed
thus with himself, God, I thank
thee, that I am a not as other men
are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
or even as this publican.

13 And the publican, standing afar
off, would not lift up so much as his
eyes unto heaven, but smote upon
his breast, saying, God be merciful
to me a a sinner.
14 I tell you, this man went down
to his house justified rather than
the other: for every one that a exalteth himself shall be abased; and
he that b humbleth himself shall be
exalted.
15 And they brought unto him also
infants, that he would touch them:
but when his disciples saw it, they
rebuked them.
16 But Jesus called them unto him,
and said, Suffer little a children to
come unto me, and forbid them not:
for of such is the kingdom of God.
17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
of God as a little child shall in no
wise enter therein.
18 And a certain ruler asked him,
saying, Good Master, what shall I do
to inherit a eternal life?
19 And Jesus said unto him, Why
callest thou me good? none is a good,
save one, that is, God.
20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit a adultery, Do
not b kill, Do not steal, Do not bear c false witness, d Honour thy father
and thy mother.
21 And he said, All these have I
kept from my youth up.
22 Now when Jesus heard these
things, he said unto him, Yet lackest
thou one thing: sell all that thou hast,
and distribute unto the a poor, and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven:
and come, follow me.
23 And when he heard this, he was
very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
24 And when Jesus saw that he
was very sorrowful, he said, How
hardly shall they that have riches
enter into the kingdom of God!
25 For it is easier for a camel to
go through a needle’s eye, than for
a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
26 And they that heard it said, Who
then can be saved?
27 a And he said, The things which
are impossible with men are b pos- sible with God.
28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have
left all, and followed thee.
29 And he said unto them, Verily
I say unto you, There is no man
that hath left house, or parents, or
brethren, or wife, or children, for
the kingdom of God’s sake,
30 Who shall not a receive b manifold more in this present time, and
in the world to come life everlasting.
31 ¶ Then he took unto him the
twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
we go up to Jerusalem, and all things
that are a written by the prophets
concerning the Son of man shall
be accomplished.
32 For he shall be delivered unto
the Gentiles, and shall be a mocked,
and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:
33 And they shall scourge him, and
put him to death: and the third day
he shall a rise again.

35 ¶ And it came to pass, that as
he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
certain blind man sat by the way
side begging:
36 And hearing the multitude pass
by, he asked what it meant.
37 And they told him, that Jesus
of Nazareth passeth by.
38 And he cried, saying, Jesus,
thou Son of David, have mercy
on me.
39 And they which went before
rebuked him, that he should hold
his peace: but he cried so much
the more, Thou Son of David, have
mercy on me.
40 And Jesus stood, and com- manded him to be brought unto
him: and when he was come near,
he asked him,
41 Saying, What wilt thou that I
shall do unto thee? And he said,
Lord, that I may receive my sight.
42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy a sight: thy b faith hath
saved thee.
43 And immediately he received
his sight, and followed him, a glori- fying God: and all the people, when
they saw it, gave praise unto God.
Chapter 19
Jesus came to save souls—He gives
the parable of the pounds—He rides
in triumph into Jerusalem, weeps over
the city, and cleanses the temple again.
And Jesus entered and passed
through Jericho.
2 And, behold, there was a man
named Zacchæus, which was the
chief among the publicans, and he
was rich.
3 And he sought to see Jesus who
he was; and could not for the a press,
because he was little of stature.
4 And he ran before, and climbed
up into a sycomore tree to see him:
for he was to pass that way.
5 And when Jesus came to the
place, he looked up, and saw him,
and said unto him, Zacchæus, make
haste, and come down; for to day I
must abide at thy house.
6 And he made haste, and came
down, and a received him joyfully.
7 And when they saw it, they all
murmured, saying, That he was
gone to be guest with a man that
is a sinner.
8 And Zacchæus stood, and said
unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the
half of my goods I give to the poor;
and if I have taken any thing from
any man by false accusation, I restore him a fourfold.
9 And Jesus said unto him, This
day is salvation come to this house,
forsomuch as he also is a son of
Abraham.
10 For the Son of man is come to
seek and to a save that which was b lost.
11 And as they heard these things,
he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem,
and because they thought that the
kingdom of God should a immediately appear.
12 He said therefore, A certain
nobleman went into a far country
to receive for himself a kingdom,
and to return.
13 And he called his ten servants,
and delivered them ten a pounds,
and said unto them, b Occupy till
I come.
14 But his a citizens hated him, and
sent a b message after him, saying,
We will not have this man to reign
over us.
15 And it came to pass, that when
he was returned, having received the
kingdom, then he commanded these
a servants to be called unto him, to
whom he had given the money, that

he might know how much every
man had gained by trading.
16 Then came the first, saying,
Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
pounds.
17 And he said unto him, Well,
thou good servant: because thou
hast been a faithful in a very little,
have thou b authority over ten cities.
18 And the second came, saying,
Lord, thy pound hath gained five
pounds.
19 And he said likewise to him, Be
thou also over five cities.
20 And another came, saying, Lord,
behold, here is thy pound, which I
have kept laid up in a napkin:
21 For I a feared thee, because
thou art an b austere man: thou
takest up that thou layedst not
down, and reapest that thou didst
not sow.
22 And he saith unto him, Out of
thine own mouth will I judge thee,
thou wicked servant. Thou knewest
that I was an austere man, taking
up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:
23 Wherefore then gavest not thou
my money into the bank, that at
my coming I might have a required
mine own with b usury ?
24 And he said unto them that stood
by, Take from him the pound, and
give it to him that hath ten pounds.
25 (And they said unto him, Lord,
he hath ten pounds.)
26 For I say unto you, That unto every one a which hath shall be given;
and from him that hath not, even
that he hath shall be taken away
from him.
27 But those mine enemies, which
would not that I should reign over
them, bring hither, and slay them
before me.
28 ¶ And when he had thus spo- ken, he went before, ascending up
to Jerusalem.
29 And it came to pass, when he
was come nigh to Bethphage and
Bethany, at the mount called the
mount of Olives, he sent two of his
disciples,
30 Saying, Go ye into the village
over against you; in the which at
your entering ye shall find a colt
tied, whereon yet never man sat:
loose him, and bring him hither.
31 And if any man ask you, Why
do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
unto him, Because the Lord hath
need of him.
32 And they that were sent went
their way, and found even as he had
said unto them.
33 And as they were loosing the
colt, the owners thereof said unto
them, Why loose ye the colt?
34 And they said, The Lord hath
need of him.
35 And they brought him to Jesus:
and they cast their garments upon
the a colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
36 And as he went, they spread
their clothes in the way.
37 And when he was come nigh,
even now at the descent of the
mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice
and praise God with a loud voice
for all the mighty works that they
had seen;
38 Saying, Blessed be the King that
cometh in the name of the Lord:
peace in heaven, and a glory in the
highest.
39 And some of the Pharisees from
among the multitude said unto him,
Master, rebuke thy disciples.
40 And he answered and said unto
them, I tell you that, if these should
hold their peace, the a stones would
immediately cry out.
41 ¶ And when he was come near,
he beheld the city, and wept over it,

43 For the days shall come upon
thee, that thine a enemies shall cast

44 And shall a lay thee even with

45 And he went into the temple,
and began to cast out them that
sold therein, and them that bought;
46 Saying unto them, It is written,
My house is the a house of prayer: but
ye have made it a b den of thieves.
47 And he taught daily in the
temple. But the chief priests and the
scribes and the chief of the people
sought to destroy him,
48 And could not find what they
might do: for all the people were
very attentive to hear him.
Chapter 20
The chief priests oppose Jesus—He
gives the parable of the wicked husbandmen—Render unto Cæsar and God
that which is theirs—Jesus teaches the
law of marriage.
And it came to pass, that on one of
those days, as he taught the people
in the temple, and preached the gos- pel, the chief priests and the scribes
came upon him with the elders,
2 And spake unto him, saying, Tell
us, by what authority doest thou
these things? or who is he that gave
thee this authority ?
3 And he answered and said unto
them, I will also ask you one thing;
and answer me:
4 The baptism of John, was it from
heaven, or of men?
5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
6 But and if we say, Of men; all
the people will stone us: for they be
persuaded that John was a a prophet.
7 And they answered, that they
could not tell whence it was.
8 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I
do these things.
9 Then began he to speak to the
people this parable; A certain man
planted a a vineyard, and let it forth
to b husbandmen, and went into a
far country for a long time.
10 And at the season he sent a
servant to the husbandmen, that
they should give him of the fruit
of the vineyard: but the husband- men beat him, and sent him away
empty.
11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
entreated him shamefully, and sent
him away empty.
12 And again he sent a third: and
they wounded him also, and cast
him out.
13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send
my beloved son: it may be they will
reverence him when they see him.
14 But when the husbandmen saw
him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come,
let us kill him, that the inheritance
may be ours.
15 So they cast him out of the vine- yard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard
do unto them?
16 He shall come and destroy
these husbandmen, and shall give
the vineyard to others. And when
they heard it, they said, a God
forbid.
17 And he beheld them, and said,

What is this then that is written,
The a stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head
of the corner?
18 Whosoever shall fall upon that
stone shall be broken; but on whom- soever it shall fall, it will a grind him
to powder.
19 ¶ And the chief priests and the
scribes the same hour sought to lay
hands on him; and they feared the
people: for they perceived that he
had spoken this parable against them.
20 And they watched him, and
sent forth spies, which should feign
themselves just men, that they might
a take hold of his words, that so they
might deliver him unto the power
and authority of the governor.
21 And they asked him, saying,
Master, we know that thou sayest
and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but
teachest the way of God truly:
22 Is it lawful for us to give a tribute unto Cæsar, or no?
23 But he perceived their a craftiness, and said unto them, Why
tempt ye me?
24 Shew me a penny. Whose image
and superscription hath it? They
answered and said, Cæsar’s.
25 And he said unto them, Render
therefore unto a Cæsar the things
which be Cæsar’s, and unto God the
things which be God’s.
26 And they could not take hold
of his words before the people: and
they marvelled at his answer, and
held their peace.
27 ¶ Then came to him certain of the
Sadducees, which deny that there is
any resurrection; and they asked him,
28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote
unto us, If any man’s a brother die,
having a wife, and he die without
children, that his b brother should
take his wife, and raise up seed unto
his brother.
29 There were therefore seven
brethren: and the first took a wife,
and died without children.
30 And the second took her to wife,
and he died childless.
31 And the third took her; and in
like manner the seven also: and they
left no children, and died.
32 Last of all the woman died also.
33 Therefore in the resurrection
whose wife of them is she? for seven
had her to wife.
34 And Jesus answering said unto
them, The children of this world
a marry, and are given in marriage:
35 But they which shall be ac- counted worthy to obtain a that
world, and the b resurrection from
the dead, neither marry, nor are
given in c marriage:
36 Neither can they die any more:
for they are equal unto the a angels;
and are the b children of God, being
the children of the resurrection.
37 Now that the dead are raised,
even Moses shewed at the a bush,
when he calleth the Lord the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob.
38 For he is not a God of the a dead,
but of the living: for all live unto
him.
39 ¶ Then certain of the scribes
answering said, Master, thou hast
well said.
40 And after that they durst not
ask him any a question at all.
41 And he said unto them, How
say they that Christ is David’s a son?

the people he said unto his disciples,
46 Beware of the a scribes, which
desire to walk in long robes, and
love greetings in the markets, and
the b highest seats in the synagogues,
and the chief rooms at feasts;
47 Which devour widows’ houses,

Chapter 21
Jesus foretells the destruction of the
temple and of Jerusalem—He tells of
the signs to precede His Second Coming and gives the parable of the fig tree.
And he looked up, and saw the a rich men casting their gifts into
the treasury.
2 And he saw also a certain poor
widow casting in thither two a mites.
3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto
you, that this poor widow hath cast
in more than they all:
4 For all these have of their abun- dance cast in unto the offerings of
God: but she of her penury hath
cast in all the living that she had.
5 ¶ And as some spake of the
temple, how it was adorned with
goodly stones and gifts, he said,
6 As for these things which ye
behold, the days will come, in the
which there shall not be left one
a stone upon another, that shall not
be thrown down.
7 And they asked him, saying,
Master, but when shall these things
be? and what a sign will there be when
these things shall come to pass?
8 And he said, Take heed that ye be
not deceived: for many shall come
in my name, saying, I am Christ;
and the time draweth near: go ye
not therefore after them.
9 But when ye shall hear of wars
and commotions, be not terrified:
for these things must first come to
pass; but the end is not by and by.
10 Then said he unto them, a Nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom:
11 And great earthquakes shall
be in divers places, and famines,
and a pestilences; and fearful sights
and great signs shall there be from
heaven.
12 But before all these, they shall
lay their hands on you, and a persecute you, delivering you up to the
synagogues, and into prisons, being
brought before kings and rulers for
my name’s sake.
13 And it shall turn to you for a
testimony.
14 Settle it therefore in your hearts,
not to a meditate before what ye
shall b answer:
15 For I will give you a mouth and a wisdom, which all your adversar- ies shall not be able to b gainsay
nor resist.
16 And ye shall be betrayed both
by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you
shall they cause to be put to death.
17 And ye shall be hated of all men
for my name’s a sake.
18 But there shall not an a hair of
your head perish.
19 In your a patience b possess ye
your souls.

20 And when ye shall see a Jerusalem compassed with b armies, then
know that the c desolation thereof
is nigh.
21 Then let them which are in
Judæa flee to the mountains; and
let them which are in the midst
of it depart out; and let not them
that are in the a countries enter
thereinto.
22 For these be the days of ven- geance, that all things which are
written may be fulfilled.
23 But woe unto them that are
with child, and to them that give
suck, in those days! for there shall
be great distress in the land, and
wrath upon this people.
24 And they shall fall by the edge
of the sword, and shall be a led away b captive into all c nations: and Je- rusalem shall be d trodden down of
the e Gentiles, until the times of the
Gentiles be fulfilled.
25 ¶ a And there shall be signs
in the sun, and in the b moon, and in
the stars; and upon the earth distress
of nations, with perplexity; the sea
and the waves roaring;
26 Men’s hearts a failing them for
fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the
earth: for the powers of heaven shall
be b shaken.
27 And then shall they see the Son
of man coming in a a cloud with
power and great glory.
28 And when these things begin to
come to pass, then look up, and lift
up your heads; for your a redemption
draweth nigh.
29 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the a fig tree, and all
the trees;
30 When they now shoot forth, ye
see and know of your own selves
that summer is now nigh at hand.
31 So likewise ye, when ye see
these things come to pass, know ye
that the kingdom of God is nigh
at hand.
32 Verily I say unto you, a This generation shall not pass away, till all
be fulfilled.
33 Heaven and earth shall pass
away: but my words shall not
pass away.
34 ¶ And take heed to yourselves,
lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with a surfeiting, and
drunkenness, and b cares of this life,
and so that c day come upon you d unawares.
35 For as a a snare shall it come on
all them that dwell on the face of
the whole earth.
36 a Watch ye therefore, and b pray
always, c that ye may be accounted d worthy to escape all these things
that shall come to pass, and to stand
before the e Son of man.
37 And in the day time he was a teaching in the temple; and at night
he went out, and abode in the mount
that is called the mount of Olives.
38 And all the people came early in
the morning to him in the temple,
for to hear him.

Jesus institutes the sacrament—He
suffers in Gethsemane and is be- trayed and arrested—Peter denies
knowing Him—Jesus is smitten and
mocked.
Now the feast of unleavened bread
drew nigh, which is called the
a Passover.
2 And the chief  a priests and b scribes
sought how they might c kill him; for
they feared the people.
3 ¶ Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
number of the twelve.
4 And he went his way, and a communed with the chief priests and
captains, how he might betray him
unto them.
5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him a money.
6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
in the absence of the multitude.
7 ¶ Then came the day of a unleav- ened bread, when the b passover
must be killed.
8 And he sent a Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover,
that we may eat.
9 And they said unto him, Where
wilt thou that we prepare?
10 And he said unto them, Behold,
when ye are entered into the city,
there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him
into the house where he entereth in.
11 And ye shall say unto the a good- man of the house, The Master saith
unto thee, Where is the guestcham- ber, where I shall eat the passover
with my disciples?
12 And he shall shew you a large
upper room furnished: there make
ready.
13 And they went, and found as
he had said unto them: and they
made ready the passover.
14 And when the hour was come,
he sat down, and the twelve apos- tles with him.
15 And he said unto them, With
desire I have desired to eat this
passover with you before I suffer:
16 For I say unto you, I will not
any more eat thereof, a until it be
fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
17 And he took the cup, and gave
thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
18 For I say unto you, I will not a drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
19 ¶ And he took a bread, and gave
thanks, and brake it, and gave unto
them, saying, This is my b body which
is c given for you: this do in d remembrance of me.
20 Likewise also the a cup after
supper, saying, This cup is the new b testament in my blood, which is
shed for you.
21 ¶ But, behold, the hand of him
that betrayeth me is with me on
the table.
22 And truly the Son of man goeth,
as it was a determined: but woe unto
that man by whom he is b betrayed!
23 And they began to inquire
among themselves, which of them
it was that should do this thing.
24 ¶ And there was also a a strife
among them, which of them should
be accounted the b greatest.

a kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exer- cise authority upon them are called
benefactors.
26 But ye shall not be so: but he
that is greatest among you, let him
be as the younger; and he that is
chief, as he that doth a serve.
27 For whether is greater, he that
sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?
is not he that sitteth at meat? but I
am among you as he that a serveth.
28 Ye are they which have a continued with me in my b temptations.
29 And I appoint unto you a king- dom, as my Father hath a appointed
unto me;
30 That ye may a eat and drink at
my table in my kingdom, and sit on
thrones b judging the twelve tribes
of Israel.
31 ¶ And the Lord said, Simon,
Simon, behold, a Satan hath desired
to b have you, that he may sift you
as wheat:
32 But I have a prayed for thee,
that thy faith fail not: and when
thou art b converted, c strengthen thy
brethren.
33 And he said unto him, Lord, I
am a ready to go with thee, both into
prison, and to death.
34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter,
the cock shall not crow this day,
before that thou shalt a thrice deny
that thou knowest me.
35 And he said unto them, When I
sent you without a purse, and scrip,
and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And
they said, Nothing.
36 Then said he unto them, But
now, he that hath a purse, let him
take it, and likewise his scrip: and
he that hath no sword, let him sell
his garment, and buy one.
37 For I say unto you, that this that
is written must yet be accomplished
in me, And he was reckoned among
the a transgressors: for the things
concerning me have an end.
38 And they said, Lord, behold,
here are two swords. And he said
unto them, It is enough.
39 ¶ And he came out, and went,
as he was a wont, to the mount of
Olives; and his disciples also fol- lowed him.
40 And when he was at the place,
he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into a temptation.
41 And he was withdrawn from
them about a stone’s cast, and
kneeled down, and prayed,
42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, a remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my b will, but thine,
be done.
43 And there appeared an a angel
unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
44 And being in an a agony he
prayed more earnestly: b and his
sweat was as it were great drops of
c blood falling down to the ground.
45 And when he rose up from
prayer, and was come to his disciples,
he found them sleeping for sorrow,
46 And said unto them, Why sleep
ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into
temptation.

called Judas, one of the twelve, went
before them, and drew near unto
Jesus to kiss him.
48 But Jesus said unto him, a Judas, b betrayest thou the Son of man
with a c kiss?
49 When they which were about
him saw what would follow, they
said unto him, Lord, shall we smite
with the sword?
50 ¶ And one of them smote the
servant of the high priest, and cut
off his right ear.
51 And Jesus answered and said,
Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
his ear, and a healed him.
52 Then Jesus said unto the chief
priests, and captains of the temple,
and the elders, which were come to
him, Be ye come out, as against a
thief, with swords and staves?
53 When I was daily with you in
the temple, ye stretched forth no
hands against me: but this is your
hour, and the power of a darkness.
54 ¶ Then took they him, and led
him, and brought him into the high
priest’s house. And Peter followed
afar off.
55 And when they had kindled a
fire in the midst of the a hall, and
were set down together, Peter sat
down among them.
56 But a certain maid beheld him
as he sat by the fire, and earnestly
looked upon him, and said, This
man was also with him.
57 And he denied him, saying,
Woman, I know him not.
58 And after a little while another
saw him, and said, Thou art also
of them. And Peter said, Man, I
am not.
59 And about the space of one hour
after another confidently affirmed,
saying, Of a truth this fellow also
was with him: for he is a Galilæan.
60 And Peter said, Man, I know not
what thou sayest. And immediately,
while he yet spake, the cock crew.
61 And the a Lord turned, and
looked upon Peter. And Peter re- membered the word of the Lord,
how he had said unto him, Before
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me
thrice.
62 And Peter went out, and wept
bitterly.
63 ¶ And the men that held Jesus a mocked him, and smote him.
64 And when they had a blindfolded
him, they struck him on the face,
and asked him, saying, Prophesy,
who is it that smote thee?
65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
66 ¶ And as soon as it was day, a the elders of the people and the
chief priests and the scribes came
together, and led him into their
council, saying,
67 Art thou the a Christ? tell us. And
he said unto them, If I tell you, ye
will not believe:
68 And if I also ask you, ye will not
answer me, nor let me go.
69 a Hereafter shall the b Son of man
sit on the right hand of the power
of God.
70 Then said they all, Art thou
then the Son of God? And he said
unto them, Ye say that I am.
71 And they said, What need we
any further a witness? for we our- selves have heard of his own mouth.

he himself is Christ a b King.
3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art
thou the King of the Jews? And he
answered him and said, Thou sayest it.
4 Then said Pilate to the chief
priests and to the people, I find no a fault in this man.
5 And they were the more fierce,
saying, He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
6 When Pilate heard of Galilee,
he asked whether the man were a
Galilæan.
7 And as soon as he knew that he
belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction,
he sent him to Herod, who himself
also was at Jerusalem at that time.
8 ¶ And when Herod saw Jesus,
he was exceeding glad: for he was
desirous to see him of a long season,
because he had heard many things
of him; and he hoped to have seen
some a miracle done by him.
9 Then he questioned with him
in many words; but he a answered
him nothing.
10 And the chief priests and a scribes
stood and vehemently accused him.
11 And Herod with his men of war
set him at nought, and a mocked him,
and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe,
and sent him again to Pilate.
12 ¶ And the same day Pilate and
Herod were made friends together:
for before they were at enmity be- tween themselves.
13 ¶ And Pilate, when he had called
together the chief priests and the
rulers and the people,
14 Said unto them, Ye have brought
this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I,
having examined him before you,
have found no fault in this man
touching those things whereof ye
accuse him:
15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you
to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of
death is done a unto him.
16 I will therefore chastise him,
and release him.
17 (For of necessity he must a release one unto them at the feast.)
18 And they cried out all at once,
saying, Away with this man, and
release unto us Barabbas:
19 (Who for a certain sedition
made in the city, and for a murder,
was cast into prison.)
20 Pilate therefore, willing to re- lease Jesus, spake again to them.
21 But they cried, saying, a Crucify
him, crucify him.
22 And he said unto them the third
time, Why, what evil hath he done?
I have found a no cause of death in
him: I will therefore chastise him,
and let him go.
23 And they were a instant with
loud voices, b requiring that he might
be c crucified. And the voices of them
and of the chief priests prevailed.
24 And Pilate gave sentence that it
should be as they a required.
25 And he released unto them him
that for sedition and a murder was
cast into prison, whom they had
desired; but he delivered Jesus to
their will.
26 And as they led him away, they
laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and
on him they laid the cross, that he
might bear it after Jesus.
27 ¶ And there followed him a
great company of people, and of
women, which also bewailed and
lamented him.
28 But Jesus turning unto them
said, Daughters of a Jerusalem, weep
not for me, but weep for yourselves,
and for your children.

29 For, behold, the days are coming,
in the which they shall say, Blessed
are the a barren, and the wombs that
never bare, and the paps which
never gave suck.
30 Then shall they begin to say to
the a mountains, Fall on us; and
to the hills, Cover us.
31 For if they do these things in a a green tree, what shall be done in
the b dry ?
32 And there were also two other, a malefactors, led with him to be
put to death.
33 And when they were come to
the place, which is called Calvary,
there they crucified him, and the
malefactors, one on the right hand,
and the other on the left.
34 ¶ Then a said Jesus, Father, b forgive them; for they know not what
c they do. And they parted his d raiment, and cast lots.
35 And the people stood behold- ing. And the rulers also with them
a derided him, saying, He saved oth- ers; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the b chosen of God.
36 And the soldiers also a mocked
him, coming to him, and offering
him b vinegar,
37 And saying, If thou be the king
of the Jews, save thyself.
38 And a superscription also was
written over him in letters of Greek,
and Latin, and Hebrew, This Is the a King of the b Jews. 39 ¶ And one of the malefactors
which were hanged a railed on him,
saying, If thou be Christ, save thy- self and us.
40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou
fear God, seeing thou art in the same
condemnation?
41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due a reward of our deeds:
but this man hath done nothing
amiss.
42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord,
remember me when thou comest
into thy kingdom.
43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily
I say unto thee, To day shalt thou
be with me in a paradise.
44 And it was about the a sixth hour,
and there was a b darkness over all
the c earth until the ninth hour.
45 And the sun was darkened, and
the veil of the temple was rent in
the a midst.
46 ¶ And when Jesus had cried with
a loud voice, he said, Father, into
thy hands I a commend my b spirit:
and having said thus, he c gave up
the d ghost.
47 Now when the centurion saw
what was done, he glorified God,
saying, Certainly this was a a righ- teous man.
48 And all the people that came
together to that sight, beholding
the things which were done, smote
their breasts, and returned.
49 And all his acquaintance, and
the women that followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding
these things.

50 ¶ And, behold, there was a man
named Joseph, a a counsellor; and he
was a good man, and a just:
51 (The same had not consented
to the counsel and deed of them;)
he was of Arimathæa, a city of the
Jews: who also himself waited for
the kingdom of God.
52 This man went unto Pilate, and a begged the body of Jesus.
53 And he took it down, and
wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
a sepulchre that was hewn in stone,
wherein never man before was laid.
54 And that day was the a preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
55 And the women also, which
came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the a sep- ulchre, and how his body was laid.
56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and
a rested the sabbath day according
to the commandment.
Chapter 24
Angels announce the resurrection of
Christ—He walks on the Emmaus
road—He appears with a body of flesh
and bones, eats food, testifies of His di- vinity, and promises the Holy Ghost—
He ascends into heaven.
Now upon the first day of the week,
very early in the morning, they came
unto the a sepulchre, bringing the
spices which they had prepared,
and certain others with them.
2 a And they found the stone rolled
away from the sepulchre.
3 And they entered in, and found
not the body of the Lord Jesus.
4 And it came to pass, as they were
much perplexed thereabout, behold,
two men stood by them in shining
garments:
5 And as they were afraid, and
bowed down their faces to the earth,
they said unto them, Why seek ye
the living among the dead?
6 He is not here, but is a risen: remember how he spake unto you
when he was yet in Galilee,
7 Saying, The Son of man must be
delivered into the hands of sinful
men, and be crucified, and the third
day rise again.
8 And they remembered his words,
9 And returned from the sepulchre,
and told all these things unto the
eleven, and to all the rest.
10 It was Mary Magdalene, and
Joanna, and Mary the mother of
James, and other women that were
with them, which told these things
unto the apostles.
11 And their words seemed to
them as idle tales, and they believed
them not.
12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto
the sepulchre; and stooping down,
he beheld the linen clothes laid by
themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was
come to pass.
13 ¶ And, behold, two of them went
that same day to a village called
Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem
a about threescore furlongs.
14 And they talked together of
all these things which had hap- pened.
15 And it came to pass, that, while
they a communed together and rea- soned, b Jesus himself drew near, and
went with them.
16 But their eyes were a holden that
they should not know him.
17 And he said unto them, What
manner of communications are these
that ye have one to another, as ye
walk, and are sad?
18 And the one of them, whose
name was a Cleopas, answering said
unto him, Art thou only a stranger
in Jerusalem, and hast not known

there in these days?
19 And he said unto them, What
things? And they said unto him,
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which
was a prophet mighty in deed and
word before God and all the people:
20 And how the chief priests and
our rulers delivered him to be con- demned to death, and have crucified him.
21 But we trusted that it had been
he which should have redeemed
Israel: and beside all this, to day
is the third day since these things
were done.
22 Yea, and certain women also of
our company made us astonished,
which were early at the sepulchre;
23 And when they found not his
body, they came, saying, that they
had also seen a vision of angels,
which said that he was alive.
24 And certain of them which were
with us went to the sepulchre, and
found it even so as the women had
said: but him they saw not.
25 Then he said unto them, O a fools, and slow of b heart to c believe
all that the prophets have spoken:
26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into
his glory ?
27 And beginning at a Moses and
all the b prophets, he c expounded
unto them in all the d scriptures the
things concerning himself.
28 And they drew nigh unto the
village, whither they went: and
he made as though he would have
gone further.
29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward
evening, and the day is far spent.
And he went in to tarry with them.
30 And it came to pass, as he sat
at meat with them, he took bread,
and blessed it, and brake, and gave
to them.
31 And their eyes were opened,
and they knew him; and he van- ished out of their sight.
32 And they said one to another,
Did not our a heart b burn within
us, while he c talked with us by the
way, and while he opened to us the
scriptures?
33 And they rose up the same hour,
and returned to Jerusalem, and
found the eleven gathered together,
and them that were with them,
34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed,
and hath a appeared to b Simon.
35 And they told what things were
done in the way, and how he was
known of them in breaking of bread.
36 ¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus
himself a stood in the midst of them,
and saith unto them, b Peace be unto
you.
37 But they were terrified and
affrighted, and supposed that they
had seen a spirit.
38 And he said unto them, Why are
ye troubled? and why do a thoughts
arise in your hearts?
39 Behold my hands and my feet,
that it is I myself: a handle me, and
see; for a b spirit hath not c flesh and
bones, as ye d see me have.
40 And when he had thus spoken,
he shewed them his hands and his
feet.
41 And while they yet believed
not for joy, and a wondered, he said
unto them, Have ye here any meat?

42 And they gave him a piece of a
broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
43 And he took it, and did eat before them.
44 And he said unto them, These
are the words which I spake unto
you, while I was yet with you, that
all things must be a fulfilled, which
were written in the law of Moses, and
in the prophets, and in the psalms,
concerning me.
45 Then opened he their a understanding, that they might under- stand the scriptures,
46 And said unto them, Thus it is
written, and thus it a behoved Christ
to suffer, and to b rise from the dead
the third day:
47 And that a repentance and b remission of sins should be c preached
in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
48 And ye are a witnesses of these
things.
49 ¶ And, behold, I send the a promise of my Father upon you: but tarry
ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye
be b endued with power from on high.

as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them.
51 And it came to pass, while he
blessed them, he was parted from
them, and a carried up into heaven.
52 And they worshipped him, and
returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
53 And were continually in the a temple, praising and blessing God.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO
ST JOHN
CHAPTER 1
Christ is the Word of God—He created
all things and was made flesh—John
baptizes Jesus and testifies that He is
the Lamb of God—John, Andrew, Simon, Philip, and Nathanael believe in
Christ and follow Him.
a I
N the b beginning was the Word,
and the c Word was with God, and
the d Word was e God.
2 The same was in the a beginning
with God.
3 All things were a made by him;
and without him was not any thing
made that was made.
1325 John 1:4–25
4 In him was a life; and the life was
the b light of men.
5 And the a light shineth in b darkness; and the darkness c comprehended it not.
6 ¶ There was a man sent from
God, whose name was a John.
7 The same came for a a witness, to
bear b witness of the Light, that all
men through him might c believe.
8 He was not that Light, but was
sent to bear witness of that Light.
9 That was the true a Light, which b lighteth c every man that cometh
into the world.
10 He was in the a world, and the b world was c made by him, and the
world d knew him not.
11 He came unto his own, and his
own a received him not.
12 But as many as a received him,
to them gave he b power to become
the c sons of God, even to them that
believe on his d name:
13 Which were a born, not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
the will of man, but of God.
14 And the Word was made a flesh,
and b dwelt among us, (and we c beheld his d glory, the glory as of the e only f begotten of the Father,) full
of g grace and truth.
15 ¶ John bare a witness of him,
and cried, saying, This was he of
whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for
he was before me.
16 And of his a fulness have all we
received, and b grace for grace.
17 a For the b law was given by
Moses, but c grace and d truth came
by Jesus Christ.
18 No a man hath b seen God c at any
time; the only begotten Son, which
is in the bosom of the Father, he
hath d declared him.
19 ¶ And this is the record of  a John, when the Jews sent priests
and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
him, Who art thou?
20 And he confessed, and denied
not; but confessed, I am not the
Christ.
21 And they asked him, What then?
Art thou a Elias? And he saith, I am
not. Art thou that prophet? And he
answered, No.
22 Then said they unto him, Who
art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What
sayest thou of thyself?
23 He said, I am the a voice of one
crying in the wilderness, Make
b straight the c way of the Lord, as
said the prophet Esaias.
24 And they which were sent were
of the Pharisees.

unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias,
neither that prophet?
26 John answered them, saying,
I baptize with a water: but there
standeth one among you, whom ye
know not;
27 a He it is, who coming after me is
preferred before me, whose b shoe’s
latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
28 These things were done in a Bethabara beyond Jordan, where
John was baptizing.
29 ¶ The next day John seeth Jesus
coming unto him, and saith, Behold
the a Lamb of God, which taketh
away the b sin of the world.
30 This is he of whom I said, After
me cometh a man which is preferred
before me: for he was before me.
31 And I knew him not: but that
he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing
with water.
32 And John a bare record, saying,
I saw the b Spirit descending from
heaven like a c dove, and it abode
upon him.
33 a And I knew him not: but he
that sent me to baptize with water,
the same said unto me, Upon whom
thou shalt see the Spirit descending,
and remaining on him, the same is
he which baptizeth with the bHoly
Ghost.
34 And I saw, and bare a record that
this is the Son of God.
35 ¶ Again the next day after John
stood, and two of his disciples;
36 And looking upon Jesus as he
walked, he saith, Behold the a Lamb
of God!
37 And the two disciples heard
him speak, and they followed Jesus.
38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them
following, and saith unto them, What
seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi,
(which is to say, being interpreted,
Master,) where dwellest thou?
39 He saith unto them, Come and
see. They came and saw where he
dwelt, and abode with him that day:
for it was about the tenth hour.
40 One of the two which heard
John speak, and a followed him, was
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
41 He first findeth his own brother
Simon, and saith unto him, We have
found the a Messias, which is, being
interpreted, the Christ.
42 And he brought him to Jesus.
And when Jesus beheld him, he said,
Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou
shalt be called a Cephas, which is by
interpretation, A stone.
43 ¶ The day following Jesus would
go forth into Galilee, and findeth

46 And Nathanael said unto him,
Can there any good thing come out
of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him,
Come and see.
47 Jesus saw a Nathanael coming to
him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no b guile!

Chapter 2
Jesus turns water into wine in Cana—
He attends the Passover, cleanses the
temple, foretells His death and resurrection, and performs miracles.
And the a third day there was a mar- riage in Cana of Galilee; and the
mother of Jesus was there:
2 And both Jesus was called, and
his disciples, to the marriage.
3 And when they wanted wine,
the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine.
4 Jesus saith unto her, a Woman,
what have I to do with thee? mine
hour is not yet come.
5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
you, do it.
6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
of the a purifying of the Jews, con- taining two or three firkins apiece.
7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the
waterpots with water. And they
filled them up to the brim.
8 And he saith unto them, Draw
out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
9 When the ruler of the feast had
tasted the water that was made wine,
and knew not whence it was: (but
the servants which drew the water
knew;) the governor of the feast
called the bridegroom,
10 And saith unto him, Every man
at the beginning doth set forth good
wine; and when men have well
drunk, then that which is worse:
but thou hast kept the good wine
until now.
11 This a beginning of b miracles
did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested forth his glory; and his
disciples believed on him.
12 ¶ After this he went down to
Capernaum, he, and his mother, and
his a brethren, and his disciples: and
they continued there not many days.
13 ¶ And the Jews’ passover was
at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem,
14 And found in the temple those
that sold oxen and sheep and
doves, and the changers of a money
sitting:
15 And when he had made a a scourge of small cords, he drove
them all out of the temple, and the
sheep, and the oxen; and poured out
the changers’ money, and overthrew
the tables;
16 And said unto them that sold
doves, Take these things hence; make
not my Father’s house an house of
merchandise.
17 And his disciples remembered
that it was written, The a zeal of thine
house hath b eaten me up.
18 ¶ Then answered the Jews and
said unto him, What a sign shewest
thou unto us, seeing that thou doest
these things?
19 Jesus answered and said unto
them, Destroy this a temple, and in
three days I will b raise it up.

three days?
21 But he spake of the temple of
his body.
22 When therefore he was risen
from the dead, his disciples re- membered that he had said this
unto them; and they believed the
scripture, and the word which Jesus
had said.
23 ¶ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the a passover, in the feast day,
many believed in his b name, when
they saw the c miracles which he did.
24 But Jesus did not a commit himself unto them, because he b knew
all c men,

was in b man.
Chapter 3
Jesus tells Nicodemus that men must
be born again—God so loved the world
that He sent His Only Begotten Son to
save men—John the Baptist testifies
that he that believes on the Son has
everlasting life.
There was a man of the Pharisees,
named a Nicodemus, a b ruler of the
Jews:
2 The same came to Jesus by night,
and said unto him, Rabbi, we know
that thou art a teacher come from
God: for no man can do these a miracles that thou doest, except b God be
with him.
3 Jesus answered and said unto
him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be a born b again, he
cannot c see the kingdom of God.
4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How
can a man be born when he is old?
can he enter the second time into
his mother’s womb, and be born?
5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I
say unto thee, Except a man be a born
of b water and of the c Spirit, he can- not d enter into the kingdom of God.
6 That which is born of the flesh
is flesh; and that which is born of
the Spirit is spirit.
7 Marvel not that I said unto thee,
Ye must be a born again.
8 The a wind bloweth where it
listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence
it cometh, and whither it goeth:
so is every one that is born of the
b Spirit.
9 Nicodemus answered and said
unto him, How can these things be?
10 Jesus answered and said unto
him, Art thou a master of Israel, and
knowest not these things?
11 a Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
We speak that we do know, and
b testify that we have seen; and ye
receive not our witness.
12 If I have told you earthly things,
and ye a believe not, how shall ye be- lieve, if I tell you of  heavenly things?
13 And no man hath a ascended up
to heaven, but he that b came down
from heaven, even the c Son of man
which is in heaven.

a serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the b Son of man be lifted up:
15 That whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have
eternal life.
16 ¶ For a God so b loved the c world,
that he d gave his e only begotten
f Son, that whosoever g believeth in
him should not perish, but have
h everlasting i life.
17 For God a sent not his Son into
the world to b condemn the world;
but that the world through him
might be c saved.
18 ¶ He that believeth on him is
not condemned: but he that a be- lieveth not is condemned already,
because he hath not believed in the
b name of the only begotten c Son
of God.
19 And this is the condemnation,
that a light is come into the world,
and men loved b darkness rather than
light, because their c deeds were evil.
20 For every one that doeth a evil b hateth the light, neither cometh
to the light, lest his deeds should
be reproved.
21 But he that a doeth b truth cometh
to the c light, that his deeds may
be made manifest, that they are
wrought in God.
22 ¶ After these things came Jesus
and his disciples into the land of
Judæa; and there he tarried with
them, and a baptized.
23 ¶ And John also was baptizing
in Ænon near to Salim, because
there was much a water there: and
they came, and were b baptized.
24 For John was not yet cast into
prison.
25 ¶ Then there arose a question
between some of John’s disciples and
the Jews about purifying.
26 And they came unto John, and
said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
with thee beyond Jordan, to whom
thou barest witness, behold, the
same baptizeth, a and all men come
to him.
27 John answered and said, A man
can a receive nothing, except it be
given him from heaven.
28 Ye yourselves bear me witness,
that I said, I am not the Christ,
but that I am sent before him.
29 He that hath the bride is the
bridegroom: but the friend of the
bridegroom, which standeth and
heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this
my joy therefore is fulfilled.
30 He must increase, but I must
decrease.
31 He that cometh from a above is
above all: he that is of the earth is
earthly, and speaketh of the earth:
he that cometh from heaven is
above all.
32 And what he hath seen and
heard, that he a testifieth; and no
man receiveth his testimony.

Chapter 4
Jesus teaches a woman of Samaria—
All must worship the Father in spirit
and truth—Those who harvest souls
gain eternal life—Many Samaritans
believe—Jesus heals a nobleman’s son.
a When therefore the Lord knew how
the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
made and baptized more disciples
than John,
2 (Though Jesus himself a baptized
not, but his disciples,)
3 He left Judæa, and departed again
into Galilee.
4 And he must needs go through
Samaria.
5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near
to the parcel of ground that Jacob
gave to his son a Joseph.
6 Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus
therefore, being wearied with his
journey, sat thus on the well: and
it was about the sixth hour.
7 There cometh a woman of Sa- maria to draw water: Jesus saith
unto her, Give me to drink.
8 (For his disciples were gone away
unto the city to buy meat.)
9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
being a Jew, askest drink of me,
which am a woman of Samaria? for
the Jews have no dealings with the
a Samaritans.
10 Jesus answered and said unto
her, If thou knewest the a gift of God,
and who it is that saith to thee, Give
me to drink; thou wouldest have
asked of him, and he would have
given thee b living water.
11 The woman saith unto him, Sir,
thou hast nothing to draw with, and
the well is deep: from whence then
hast thou that living water?
12 Art thou greater than our father
Jacob, which gave us the well, and
drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
13 Jesus answered and said unto
her, Whosoever drinketh of this
water shall thirst again:
14 But whosoever drinketh of the
water that I shall give him shall
never a thirst; but the water that I
shall give him shall be in him a well
of water b springing up into c ever- lasting life.
15 The woman saith unto him, Sir,
give me this water, that I thirst not,
neither come hither to draw.
16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy
husband, and come hither.
17 The woman answered and said,
I have no husband. Jesus said unto
her, Thou hast well said, I have no
husband:
18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast

certified that.

is not thy husband: in that saidst

19 The woman saith unto him, Sir,
I perceive that thou art a a prophet.
20 Our fathers worshipped in a this
mountain; and ye say, that in Jeru- salem is the place where men ought
to worship.
21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman,
believe me, the hour cometh, when
ye shall neither in this mountain,
nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
Father.
22 Ye worship ye a know not what:
we know what we worship: for sal- vation is of the Jews.
23 But the hour cometh, and now
is, when the true worshippers shall
a worship the Father in spirit and in
b truth: for the Father seeketh such
to worship him.
24 a God is a b Spirit: and they that
worship him must worship him in
spirit and in c truth.
25 The woman saith unto him, I
know that a Messias cometh, which
is called Christ: when he is come,
he will b tell us all things.
26 Jesus saith unto her, a I that speak
unto thee am he.
27 ¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
with the woman: yet no man said,
What seekest thou? or, Why talkest
thou with her?
28 The woman then left her wa- terpot, and went her way into the
city, and saith to the men,
29 Come, see a man, which told
me all things that ever I did: is not
this the Christ?
30 Then they went out of the city,
and came unto him.
31 ¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
32 But he said unto them, I have
meat to eat that ye know not of.
33 Therefore said the disciples one
to another, Hath any man brought
him ought to eat?
34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat
is to do the a will of him that sent
me, and to finish his b work.
35 Say not ye, There are yet four
months, and then cometh harvest?
behold, I say unto you, Lift up your
eyes, and look on the a fields; for
they are white already to b harvest.
36 And he that reapeth receiveth a wages, and gathereth fruit unto life
eternal: that both he that soweth
and he that reapeth may b rejoice
together.
37 And herein is that saying true,
One a soweth, and another reapeth.
38 I sent you to a reap that whereon
ye bestowed no labour: b other men
laboured, and ye are entered into
their labours.
39 ¶ And many of the Samaritans
of that city believed on him for
the saying of the woman, which
testified, He told me all that ever
I did.
40 So when the Samaritans were
come unto him, they besought him
that he would tarry with them: and
he abode there two days.
41 And many more believed be- cause of his own word;
42 And said unto the woman,
Now we believe, not because of
thy saying: for we have heard him
ourselves, and know that this is in- deed the a Christ, the b Saviour of the
world.

43 ¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
44 For Jesus himself testified, that
a prophet hath no honour in his
own country.
45 Then when he was come into
Galilee, the Galilæans received him,
having seen all the things that he
did at Jerusalem at the feast: for
they also went unto the feast.
46 So Jesus came again into Cana
of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain
nobleman, whose son was sick at
a Capernaum.
47 When he heard that Jesus was
come out of Judæa into Galilee, he
went unto him, and besought him
that he would come down, and heal
his son: for he was at the point of
death.
48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see a signs and wonders, ye
will not believe.
49 The nobleman saith unto him,
Sir, come down ere my child die.
50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy
way; thy son a liveth. And the man
believed the word that Jesus had
spoken unto him, and he went his
way.
51 And as he was now going down,
his servants met him, and told him,
saying, Thy son liveth.
52 Then inquired he of them the
hour when he began to amend.
And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
left him.
53 So the father knew that it was
at the same hour, in the which Jesus
said unto him, Thy son liveth: and
a himself believed, and his whole
house.
54 This is again the a second miracle
that Jesus did, when he was come
out of Judæa into Galilee.
Chapter 5
Jesus heals an invalid on the Sabbath—
He explains why men must honor the
Son—Jesus promises to take the gospel
to the dead—Man is resurrected, judged,
and assigned his glory by the Son—Jesus
obeys the divine law of witnesses.
After this there was a a feast of the
Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the
sheep market a pool, which is called
in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda,
having five porches.
3 In these lay a great multitude
of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
withered, waiting for the moving
of the water.
4 For an angel went down at a
certain season into the pool, and
troubled the water: whosoever then
first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of
whatsoever disease he had.
5 And a certain man was there,
which had an infirmity thirty and
eight years.
6 When Jesus saw him lie, and
knew that he had been now a long
time in that case, he saith unto him,
Wilt thou be made whole?
7 The impotent man answered
him, Sir, I have no man, when the
water is troubled, to put me into
the pool: but while I am coming,
another steppeth down before me.
8 Jesus saith unto him, a Rise, take
up thy bed, and walk.
9 And immediately the man was
made a whole, and took up his bed,
and walked: and on the same day
was the b sabbath.
10 ¶ The Jews therefore said unto
him that was cured, It is the a sab- bath day: it is not lawful for thee
to carry thy bed.
11 He answered them, He that
made me whole, the same said unto
me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

in the temple, and said unto him,
Behold, thou art made whole: sin
no more, lest a worse thing come
unto thee.
15 The man departed, and told the
Jews that it was Jesus, which had
made him whole.
16 And therefore did the Jews a persecute Jesus, and b sought to slay him,
because he had done these things
on the sabbath day.
17 ¶ But Jesus answered them,
My Father a worketh hitherto, and
I b work.
18 Therefore the Jews sought the
more to kill him, because he not
only had broken the sabbath, but
said also that God was his a Father,
making himself b equal with God.
19 Then answered Jesus and said
unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he a seeth the b Father
do: for what things soever he doeth,
these also doeth the Son likewise.
20 For the Father loveth the Son,
and sheweth him all things that
himself doeth: and he will shew
him greater works than these, that
ye may marvel.
21 For as the Father a raiseth up the
dead, and b quickeneth them; even so
the Son quickeneth whom he will.
22 For the Father judgeth no man,
but hath a committed all b judgment
unto the Son:
23 That all men should a honour
the Son, even as they honour the
Father. He that b honoureth not the
Son honoureth not the Father which
hath sent him.
24 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that heareth my word, and a believeth on him that sent me, hath
everlasting b life, and shall not come
into c condemnation; but is passed
from d death unto e life.
25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The
hour is coming, and now is, when
the a dead shall b hear the voice of
the Son of God: and they that hear
shall c live.
26 For as the Father hath life in
himself; so hath he given to the a Son
to have b life in himself;
27 And hath given him a authority
to execute b judgment also, because
he is the c Son of man.
28 Marvel not at this: for the hour
is coming, in the which all that
are in the a graves shall b hear his
voice,
29 And shall a come forth; b they
that have done good, unto the c res- urrection of life; and they that have
done d evil, unto the resurrection of e
damnation.

nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
judgment is a just; because I seek
not mine own b will, but the c will
of the Father which hath sent me.
31 If I bear witness of myself, my
witness is not true.
32 ¶ There is another that beareth a witness of me; and I know that the
b witness which he witnesseth of
me is true.
33 Ye sent unto a John, and he bare b witness unto the truth.
34 a But I receive not testimony
from man: but these things I say,
that ye might be saved.
35 He was a burning and a shin- ing a light: and ye were willing for a
season to rejoice in his b light.
36 ¶ a But I have b greater witness
than that of John: for the c works
which the Father hath given me to
finish, the same d works that I do,
bear witness of me, that the Father
hath e sent me.
37 And the Father himself, which
hath sent me, hath borne a witness
of me. Ye have neither heard his
voice at any time, nor b seen his
shape.
38 And ye have not his word abid- ing in you: for whom he hath sent,
him ye a believe not.
39 ¶ a Search the scriptures; for
in them ye think ye have eternal
life: and they are they which b testify of me.
40 And ye will not come to me,
that ye might have a life.
41 I receive not a honour from men.
42 But I know you, that ye have
not the a love of God in you.
43 I am come in my a Father’s b name, and ye c receive me not: if
another shall come in his own name,
him ye will receive.
44 How can ye believe, which receive a honour one of another, and
seek not the b honour that cometh
from God only ?
45 Do not think that I will accuse
you to the Father: there is one that
accuseth you, even Moses, in whom
ye trust.
46 For had ye believed a Moses,
ye would have believed me: for he
b wrote of me.
47 But if ye believe not his a writings, how shall ye believe my words?

After these things Jesus went over

mountain, and there he sat with
his disciples.
4 And the a passover, a feast of the
Jews, was nigh.
5 ¶ When Jesus then lifted up
his eyes, and saw a great company
come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread,
that these may eat?
6 And this he said to prove him: for
he himself knew what he would do.
7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them, that every one
of them may take a little.
8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Si- mon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,
9 There is a lad here, which hath
five barley loaves, and two small
fishes: but what are they among
so many ?
10 And Jesus said, Make the men
sit down. Now there was much grass
in the place. So the men sat down,
in number about a five thousand.
11 And Jesus took the loaves; and
when he had given a thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the dis- ciples to them that were set down;
and likewise of the fishes as much
as they would.
12 When they were filled, he said
unto his disciples, Gather up the
fragments that remain, that nothing be a lost.
13 Therefore they gathered them
together, and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five bar- ley loaves, which remained over
and above unto them that had
eaten.
14 Then those men, when they had
seen the a miracle that Jesus did, said,
This is of a truth that b prophet that
should come into the world.
15 ¶ When Jesus therefore per- ceived that they would come and
take him by force, to make him
a a king, he departed again into a
mountain himself alone.
16 And when even was now come,
his disciples went down unto the sea,
17 And entered into a ship, and
went over the sea toward Caper- naum. And it was now dark, and
Jesus was not come to them.
18 And the sea arose by reason of
a great wind that blew.
19 So when they had rowed about
five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
they see Jesus walking on the sea,
and drawing nigh unto the ship:
and they were a afraid.
20 But he saith unto them, It is I;
be not afraid.
21 Then they willingly received
him into the ship: and immediately
the ship was at the land whither
they went.
22 ¶ The day following, when the
people which stood on the other
side of the sea saw that there was
none other boat there, save that one
whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with
his disciples into the boat, but that
his disciples were gone away alone;
23 (Howbeit there came other boats
from Tiberias nigh unto the place
where they did eat bread, after that
the Lord had given thanks:)
24 When the people therefore saw
that Jesus was not there, neither his
disciples, they also took shipping,
and came to Capernaum, seeking
for Jesus.
25 And when they had found him
on the other side of the sea, they
said unto him, Rabbi, when camest
thou hither?
26 Jesus answered them and said,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek
me, a not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the
loaves, and were filled.

perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life, which
the b Son of man shall give unto you:
for him hath God the Father c sealed.
28 Then said they unto him, What
shall we do, that we might work the
works of God?
29 Jesus answered and said unto
them, This is the work of God, that ye
a believe on him whom he hath sent.
30 They said therefore unto him,
What a sign shewest thou then, that
we may see, and believe thee? what
dost thou work?
31 Our fathers did eat manna in
the desert; as it is written, He gave
them a bread from heaven to eat.
32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave
you not that bread from heaven;
but my Father giveth you the true
bread from heaven.
33 For the bread of God is he which
cometh down from heaven, and giv- eth life unto the world.
34 Then said they unto him, Lord,
evermore give us this bread.
35 And Jesus said unto them, I am
the a bread of life: he that cometh to
me shall never hunger; and he that
believeth on me shall never b thirst.
36 But I said unto you, That ye
also have seen me, and believe not.
37 All that the Father a giveth me
shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise
b cast out.
38 For I a came down from heaven,
not to do mine own b will, but the c will of him that sent me.
39 And this is the a Father’s b will
which hath sent me, that of all
which he hath given me I should
lose c nothing, but should d raise it
up again at the last day.
40 And this is the will of him that
sent me, that every one which seeth
the Son, and a believeth on him, may
have b everlasting life: and I will raise
him up c at the last day.
41 The Jews then murmured at
him, because he said, I am the bread
which came down from heaven.
42 And they said, Is not this Jesus,
the son of a Joseph, whose father
and mother we know? how is it then
that he saith, I came down from
heaven?
43 Jesus therefore answered and
said unto them, a Murmur not among
yourselves.
44 a No man can b come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
c draw him: and I will raise him up
at the last day.
45 It is written in the prophets, And
they shall be all a taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard,
and hath learned of the b Father,
cometh unto me.
46 Not that any man hath seen the
Father, save he which is of God, he
hath a seen the Father.
47 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that a believeth on me hath b everlasting life.
48 I am that bread of life.

down from heaven, that a man may
eat thereof, and not die.
51 I am the living a bread which
came down from heaven: if any
man eat of this bread, he shall live
for ever: and the b bread that I will
give is my c flesh, which I will d give
for the e life of the world.
52 The Jews therefore strove among
themselves, saying, How can this
man give us his flesh to eat?
53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye
a eat the flesh of the b Son of man,
and drink his blood, ye have no life
in you.
54 Whoso eateth my a flesh, and
drinketh my b blood, hath eternal
life; c and I will d raise him up at
the last day.
55 For my flesh is meat indeed,
and my blood is drink indeed.
56 He that eateth my flesh, and
drinketh my blood, a dwelleth in
me, and I in him.
57 As the living Father hath a sent
me, and I live by the Father: so he
that eateth me, even he shall b live
by me.
58 This is that bread which came
down from heaven: not as your
fathers did eat manna, and are dead:
he that eateth of this bread shall
live for ever.
59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
60 Many therefore of his disciples,
when they had heard this, said, This
is an hard saying; who can hear it?
61 When Jesus a knew in himself
that his disciples murmured at it,
he said unto them, Doth this b offend you?
62 What and if ye shall see the a Son of man b ascend up where he
was before?
63 It is the a spirit that quickeneth;
the flesh profiteth nothing: the
words that I speak unto you, they
are spirit, and they are life.
64 But there are some of you that
believe not. For Jesus knew from
the beginning who they were that
believed not, and who should a betray him.
65 And he said, Therefore said I
unto you, that no man can come
unto me, a except it were given unto
him of my Father.
66 ¶ From that time many of his a disciples went back, and b walked
no more with him.
67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve,
Will ye also go away ?
68 Then Simon Peter answered
him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
thou hast the a words of eternal life.
69 And a we believe and are sure
that thou art that Christ, the b Son
of the living God.
70 Jesus answered them, Have not
I a chosen you twelve, and one of
you is a devil?
71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son
of Simon: for he it was that should
betray him, being one of the twelve.

Jesus offers living water to all people—
The people have various opinions concerning Him.
After these things Jesus walked
in Galilee: for he would not walk
in Jewry, because the Jews a sought
to b kill him.
2 Now the Jews’ a feast of tabernacles was at hand.
3 His a brethren therefore said
unto him, Depart hence, and go
into Judæa, that thy disciples also
may see the works that thou doest.
4 For there is no man that doeth
any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If
thou do these things, shew thyself
to the world.
5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.
6 Then Jesus said unto them, My a time is not yet come: but your time
is alway ready.
7 The world cannot hate you; but
me it a hateth, because I testify of
it, that the works thereof are b evil.
8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not
up yet unto this feast; for my time
is not yet full come.
9 When he had said these words
unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
10 ¶ But when his brethren were
gone up, then went he also up unto
the feast, not openly, but as it were
in secret.
11 Then the Jews sought him at the
feast, and said, Where is he?
12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning
him: for some said, He is a good man:
others said, Nay; but he deceiveth
the people.
13 Howbeit no man spake openly
of him for a fear of the Jews.
14 ¶ Now about the midst of the
feast Jesus went up into the temple,
and taught.
15 And the Jews a marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned?
16 Jesus answered them, and said,
My a doctrine is not mine, but his
that b sent me.
17 If any man will a do his b will, he
shall c know of the doctrine, whether
it be of God, or whether I speak of
myself.
18 He that speaketh of himself
seeketh his own a glory: but he
that seeketh his b glory that sent
him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
19 Did not Moses give you the law,
and yet none of you keepeth the law?
Why go ye about to kill me?
20 The people answered and said,
Thou hast a devil: who goeth about
to kill thee?
21 Jesus answered and said unto
them, I have done one work, and
ye all marvel.
22 Moses therefore gave unto you a circumcision; (not because it is
of Moses, but of the fathers;) and
ye on the sabbath day circumcise
a man.
23 If a man on the a sabbath day
receive circumcision, that the law
of Moses should not be broken;
are ye angry at me, because I have
made a man every whit b whole on
the sabbath day ?
24 a Judge not according to b the c appearance, but judge righteous
judgment.
25 Then said some of them of
Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
seek to kill?
26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and

they say nothing unto him. Do the
a rulers know indeed that this is the
very Christ?
27 Howbeit we know this man
whence he is: but when Christ
cometh, no man knoweth whence
he is.
28 Then cried Jesus in the temple
as he taught, saying, Ye both know
me, and ye know whence I am: and
I am not come of myself, but he that
sent me is a true, whom ye know not.
29 But I know him: for I am from
him, and he hath a sent me.
30 Then they a sought to take him:
but no man laid hands on him, be- cause his b hour was not yet come.
31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
cometh, will he do more miracles
than these which this man hath done?
32 ¶ The Pharisees heard that
the people murmured such things
concerning him; and the Pharisees
and the chief priests sent officers
to take him.
33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a
little while am I with you, and then
I go unto him that sent me.
34 Ye shall a seek me, and shall not
find me: and b where I am, c thither ye d cannot come.
35 Then said the Jews among them- selves, Whither will he go, that we
shall not find him? will he go unto
the dispersed among the a Gentiles,
and teach the Gentiles?
36 What manner of saying is this
that he said, Ye shall seek me, and
shall not find me: and where I am,
thither ye cannot come?
37 In the last day, that great day
of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
saying, If any man a thirst, let him
come unto me, and b drink.
38 He that believeth on me, as the
scripture hath said, out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water.
39 (But this spake he of the a Spirit,
which they that believe on him
should receive: b for the Holy Ghost
was not yet given; because that
Jesus was not yet glorified.)
40 ¶ Many of the people therefore,
when they heard this saying, said,
Of a truth this is the a Prophet.
41 Others said, This is the Christ.
But some said, Shall Christ come
out of Galilee?
42 Hath not the scripture said, That a Christ cometh of the seed of b David,
and out of the town of c Bethlehem,
where David was?
43 So there was a a division among
the people because of him.
44 And some of them would have
taken him; but no man laid hands
on him.
45 ¶ Then came the officers to the
chief priests and Pharisees; and they
said unto them, Why have ye not
brought him?
46 The officers answered, Never
man a spake like this man.
47 Then answered them the Phari- sees, Are ye also a deceived?
48 Have any of the rulers or of the
Pharisees believed on him?
49 But this people who knoweth
not the law are a cursed.

that came to Jesus by night, being
one of them,)

Chapter 8
The woman taken in adultery is brought
before Christ—Christ is the Light of
the world—He again proclaims that
He is the Messiah—The true children
of Abraham believe in Christ—Jesus
says, Before Abraham was I, Jehovah.
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
2 And early in the morning he came
again into the a temple, and all the
people came unto him; and he sat
down, and taught them.
3 And the scribes and Pharisees
brought unto him a a woman taken
in b adultery; and when they had set
her in the midst,
4 They say unto him, Master, this
woman was taken in adultery, in
the very act.
5 Now Moses in the a law com- manded us, that such should be
stoned: but what sayest thou?
6 This they said, tempting him,
that they might have to accuse him.
But Jesus stooped down, and with
his finger a wrote on the ground, as
though he heard them not.
7 So when they continued asking
him, he lifted up himself, and said
unto them, He that is without a sin
among you, let him b first cast a c stone at her.
8 And again he stooped down, and
wrote on the ground.
9 And they which heard it, being
convicted by their own a conscience,
went out one by one, beginning at
the eldest, even unto the last: and
Jesus was left alone, and the woman
standing in the midst.
10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,
he said unto her, Woman, where are
those thine accusers? hath no man
condemned thee?
11 She said, No man, Lord. And
Jesus said unto her, Neither do I a condemn thee: go, and b sin no c more.
12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto
them, saying, I am the a light of the
world: he that followeth me shall
not b walk in c darkness, but shall
have the light of life.
13 The Pharisees therefore said
unto him, Thou bearest record of
thyself; thy record is not true.
14 Jesus answered and said unto
them, Though I bear record of my- self, yet my record is true: for I know a whence I came, and whither I go;
but ye cannot tell b whence I come,
and whither I go.
15 Ye judge after the flesh; I a judge
no man.
16 And yet if I a judge, my b judgment is true: for I am not c alone,
but I and the Father that sent me.
17 It is also written in your law, that
the a testimony of two men is true.
18 I am one that bear witness of
myself, and the a Father that sent
me beareth b witness of me.
19 Then said they unto him, Where
is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
neither know me, nor my Father: if
ye had a known me, ye should have
known my Father also.

treasury, as he taught in the temple:
and no man laid hands on him; for
his hour was not yet come.
21 Then said Jesus again unto them,
I go my way, and ye shall seek me,
and shall die in your a sins: whither
I go, ye cannot come.
22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill
himself? because he saith, Whither
I go, ye cannot come.
23 And he said unto them, Ye are
from a beneath; I am from above:
ye are of this b world; I am not of
this world.
24 I said therefore unto you, that
ye shall a die in your sins: for if ye b believe not that I am he, ye shall
die in your sins.
25 Then said they unto him, Who
art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
Even the same that I said unto you
from the beginning.
26 I have many things to say and to
judge of you: but he that sent me is
true; and I speak to the world those
things which I have a heard of him.
27 They understood not that he
spake to them of the Father.
28 Then said Jesus unto them,
When ye have lifted up the Son of
man, then shall ye know that I am
he, and that I do a nothing of myself;
but as my b Father hath c taught me,
I d speak these things.
29 And he that a sent me is with me:
the Father hath not left me b alone;
for I c do always those things that d please him.
30 As he spake these words, many a believed on him.
31 Then said Jesus to those Jews
which believed on him, If ye a continue in my word, then are ye my b disciples indeed;
32 And ye shall a know the b truth,
and the c truth shall make you d free.
33 ¶ They answered him, We be a Abraham’s seed, and were never
in bondage to any man: how sayest
thou, Ye shall be made free?
34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever a com- mitteth b sin is the c servant of sin.
35 And the servant abideth not
in the house for ever: but the Son
abideth ever.
36 If the Son therefore shall make
you a free, ye shall be free indeed.
37 I know that ye are Abraham’s
seed; but ye seek to kill me, because
my word hath no place in you.
38 I speak that which I have seen
with my Father: and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father.
39 They answered and said
unto him, Abraham is our father.
Jesus saith unto them, If ye were
a Abraham’s b children, ye would do
the c works of Abraham.
40 But now ye seek to kill me, a
man that hath told you the truth,
which I have heard of God: this did
not Abraham.
41 Ye do the deeds of your father.
Then said they to him, We be not
born of fornication; we have one
Father, even God.
42 Jesus said unto them, If God
were your Father, ye would love
me: for I proceeded forth and a came

from God; neither came I of myself,
but he b sent me.
43 Why do ye not understand my
speech? even because ye cannot a hear my word.
44 Ye are of your father the a devil,
and the b lusts of your father ye will
do. He was a c murderer from the
beginning, and abode not in the
d truth, because there is no truth in
him. When he speaketh a e lie, he
speaketh of his own: for he is a f liar,
and the father of it.
45 And because I tell you the truth,
ye believe me not.
46 Which of you a convinceth me
of b sin? And if I say the truth, why
do ye not believe me?
47 a He that is of God b heareth God’s
words: ye therefore hear them not,
because ye are not of God.
48 Then answered the Jews, and
said unto him, Say we not well that
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a
a devil?
49 Jesus answered, I have not a
devil; but I a honour my Father, and
ye do dishonour me.
50 And I seek not mine own a glory: there is one that seeketh and
judgeth.
51 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
If a man keep my saying, he shall
never see a death.
52 Then said the Jews unto him,
Now we know that thou hast a devil.
Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep
my saying, he shall never a taste of
death.
53 Art thou greater than our father
Abraham, which is dead? and the
prophets are dead: whom makest
thou thyself?
54 Jesus answered, If I honour
myself, my honour is nothing: it is
my a Father that b honoureth me; of
whom ye say, that he is your God:
55 Yet ye have not known him; but
I know him: and if I should say, I
know him not, I shall be a liar like
unto you: but I know him, and keep
his saying.
56 Your father a Abraham b rejoiced
to c see my day: and he saw it, and
was glad.
57 Then said the Jews unto him,
Thou art not yet fifty years old, and
hast thou seen Abraham?
58 Jesus said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, a Before Abraham was, b I am.
59 Then took they up a stones to
cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
and went out of the temple, going
through the midst of them, and so
b passed by.

2 And his disciples asked him,
saying, Master, who did sin, this
a man, or his parents, that he was
born blind?
3 Jesus answered, Neither hath
this man sinned, nor his parents:
but that the a works of God should
be made b manifest in him.
4 I must a work the b works of him
that sent me, c while it is d day: the e night cometh, when no man can
work.
5 As long as I am in the world, I
am the a light of the world.
6 When he had thus spoken, he
spat on the ground, and made clay
of the spittle, and he anointed the
eyes of the blind man with the clay,
7 And said unto him, Go, wash in
the pool of a Siloam, (which is by
interpretation, Sent.) He went his
way therefore, and washed, and
came seeing.
8 ¶ The neighbours therefore, and
they which before had seen him
that he was blind, said, Is not this
he that sat and begged?
9 Some said, This is he: others
said, He is like him: but he said, I
am he.
10 Therefore said they unto him,
How were thine eyes opened?
11 He answered and said, A man
that is called Jesus made clay, and
anointed mine eyes, and said unto
me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and
a wash: and I went and washed, and
I received b sight.
12 Then said they unto him, Where
is he? He said, I know not.
13 ¶ They brought to the Phari- sees him that aforetime was blind.
14 And it was the a sabbath day
when Jesus made the clay, and
b opened his eyes.
15 Then again the Pharisees also
asked him how he had received his
sight. He said unto them, He put
clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,
and do see.
16 Therefore said some of the
Pharisees, This man is not of God,
because he keepeth not the sabbath
day. Others said, How can a man
that is a sinner do such miracles?
And there was a division among
them.
17 They say unto the blind man
again, What sayest thou of him, that
he hath opened thine eyes? He said,
He is a a prophet.
18 But the Jews did not believe
concerning him, that he had been
blind, and received his sight, until
they called the parents of him that
had received his sight.
19 And they asked them, saying, Is
this your son, who ye say was born
blind? how then doth he now see?
20 His parents answered them and
said, We know that this is our son,
and that he was born blind:
21 But by what means he now
seeth, we know not; or who hath
opened his eyes, we know not: he is
of age; ask him: he shall speak for
himself.
22 These words spake his parents,
because they feared the Jews: for
the Jews had agreed already, that
if any man did confess that he was
Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue.
23 Therefore said his parents, He
is of age; ask him.
24 Then again called they the man
that was blind, and said unto him,
Give God the praise: we know that
this man is a sinner.
25 He answered and said, Whether
he be a sinner or no, I know not: one
thing I know, that, whereas I was
blind, now I see.

What did he to thee? how opened
he thine eyes?
27 He answered them, I have told
you already, and ye did not hear:
wherefore would ye hear it again?
will ye also be his disciples?
28 Then they a reviled him, and
said, Thou art his disciple; but we
are Moses’ disciples.
29 We know that God spake unto
Moses: as for this fellow, we know
not from a whence he is.
30 The man answered and said
unto them, Why herein is a mar- vellous thing, that ye know not
from whence he is, and yet he hath
opened mine eyes.
31 Now we know that God heareth
not sinners: but if any man be a
worshipper of God, and doeth his
will, him he heareth.
32 Since the world began was it
not heard that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born a blind.
33 If this man were not of a God,
he could do nothing.
34 They answered and said unto
him, Thou wast altogether born in
sins, and dost thou teach us? And
they cast him out.
35 Jesus heard that they had cast
him out; and when he had found
him, he said unto him, Dost thou
believe on the Son of God?
36 He answered and said, Who is he,
Lord, that I might believe on him?
37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou
hast both seen him, and it is he that
talketh with thee.
38 And he said, Lord, I believe.
And he worshipped him.
39 ¶ And Jesus said, For a judgment
I am come into this world, that
they which b see not might see; and
that they which see might be made
blind.
40 And some of the Pharisees which
were with him heard these words,
and said unto him, Are we blind
also?
41 Jesus said unto them, If ye were a blind, ye should have no b sin: but
now ye say, We c see; therefore your d sin remaineth.
Chapter 10
Jesus is the Good Shepherd—He gained
power over death from His Father—He
promises to visit His other sheep—He
proclaims, I am the Son of God.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that entereth not by the door into
the sheepfold, but climbeth up some
other way, the same is a thief and
a robber.
2 But he that entereth in by the
door is the shepherd of the a sheep.
3 To him the porter openeth; and
the sheep hear his a voice: and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and
b leadeth them out.
4 And when he putteth forth his
own sheep, he goeth before them,
and the sheep follow him: for they
a know his b voice.
5 And a stranger will they not fol- low, but will flee from him: for they
know not the voice of a strangers.
6 This parable spake Jesus unto
them: but they understood not what
things they were which he spake
unto them.
7 Then said Jesus unto them again,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am
the a door of the sheep.
8 All that ever came before me a are
thieves and robbers: but the sheep
did not hear them.
9 I am the door: by me if any man
enter in, he shall be saved, and shall
go in and out, and find pasture.

am come that they might have b life,
and that they might have it more c abundantly.
11 I am the good a shepherd: the
good b shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep.
12 But he that is an hireling, and
not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and a leaveth the sheep, and
fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them,
and scattereth the sheep.
13 The a hireling fleeth, because
he is an hireling, and careth not
for the sheep.
14 I am the good a shepherd, and b know my c sheep, and am known
of mine.
15 As the Father knoweth me, even
so a know I the Father: and I lay down
my b life for the sheep.
16 And a other b sheep I have, which
are not of this fold: them also I must
bring, and they shall hear my voice;
and there shall be c one fold, and
one shepherd.
17 Therefore doth my Father a love
me, because I b lay down my life,
that I might c take it again.
18 No man a taketh it from me,
but I lay it down of myself. I have
b power to lay it down, and I have
c power to take it again. This com- mandment have I d received of my
Father.
19 ¶ There was a division there- fore again among the Jews for these
sayings.
20 And many of them said, He
hath a devil, and is mad; why hear
ye him?
21 Others said, These are not the
words of him that hath a devil. Can
a devil open the eyes of the blind?
22 ¶ And it was at Jerusalem the
feast of the dedication, and it was
winter.
23 And Jesus walked in the temple
in Solomon’s a porch.
24 Then came the Jews round about
him, and said unto him, How long
dost thou make us to a doubt? If thou
be the Christ, tell us plainly.
25 Jesus answered them, I told you,
and ye a believed not: the b works that
I do in my Father’s c name, they bear

26 But ye believe not, because ye
are not of my sheep, as I said unto
you.
27 My a sheep hear my voice, and
I know them, and they b follow me:
28 And I give unto them eternal
life; and they shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them
out of my hand.
29 My Father, which a gave them
me, is greater than all; and no man
is able to pluck them out of my
Father’s hand.
30 I and my Father are a one.
31 Then the Jews took up a stones
again to stone him.
32 Jesus answered them, Many good
works have I shewed you from my
Father; for which of those works do
ye stone me?
33 The Jews answered him, saying,

For a good work we stone thee not;
but for a blasphemy; and because
that thou, being a man, makest
thyself b God.
34 Jesus answered them, Is it not
written in your law, I said, Ye are
a gods?
35 If he called them gods, unto
whom the word of God came, and
the scripture cannot be broken;
36 Say ye of him, whom the Father
hath a sanctified, and b sent into the
world, Thou blasphemest; because
I said, I am the c Son of God?
37 If I do not the works of my
Father, believe me not.
38 But if I do, though ye believe not
me, a believe the works: that ye may
know, and believe, that the b Father
is in me, and I in him.
39 Therefore they a sought again
to take him: but he escaped out of
their hand,
40 And went away again beyond
Jordan into the place where John at
first baptized; and there he abode.
41 And many resorted unto him,
and said, John did no miracle: but
all things that John spake of this
man were true.
42 And many believed on him
there.
Chapter 11
Jesus testifies that He is the Resurrection
and the Life—Mary and Martha testify
of Him—He raises Lazarus from the
dead—Caiaphas speaks prophetically
of the death of Jesus.
Now a certain man was sick, named
Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of
Mary and her sister a Martha.
2 a (It was that Mary which anointed
the b Lord with c ointment, and wiped
his feet with her hair, whose brother
Lazarus was sick.)
3 Therefore his sisters sent unto
him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom
thou lovest is sick.
4 When Jesus heard that, he said,
This sickness is not unto death, but
for the a glory of God, that the Son
of God might be b glorified thereby.
5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her
sister, and Lazarus.
6 When he had heard therefore
that he was sick, he abode two days
still in the same place where he was.
7 Then after that saith he to his dis- ciples, Let us go into Judæa again.
8 His disciples say unto him,
Master, the Jews of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither
again?
9 Jesus answered, Are there not
twelve hours in the day ? If any man
a walk in the day, he stumbleth not,
because he seeth the light of this
world.
10 But if a man walk in the night,
he stumbleth, because there is no
light in him.
11 These things said he: and after
that he saith unto them, Our friend
Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may
a awake him out of sleep.
12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if
he sleep, he shall a do well.
13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his
death: but they thought that he had
spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
14 Then said Jesus unto them
plainly, Lazarus is dead.
15 And I am glad for your sakes
that I was not there, to the intent
ye may a believe; nevertheless let us
go unto him.

disciples, Let us also go, that we
may die with a him.
17 Then when Jesus came, a he
found that he had lain in the grave
four days already.
18 Now Bethany was nigh unto
Jerusalem, about fifteen a furlongs
off:
19 And many of the Jews came to
Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning their brother.
20 Then Martha, as soon as she
heard that Jesus was coming, went
and met him: but Mary sat still in
the house.
21 Then said Martha unto Jesus,
Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.
22 But I know, that even now,
whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
God will a give it thee.
23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother
shall rise again.
24 Martha saith unto him, I know
that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
25 Jesus said unto her, I am the a resurrection, and the b life: he that c believeth in me, though he were
d dead, yet shall he e live:
26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never a die.
Believest thou this?
27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord:
I believe that thou art the Christ,
the a Son of God, which should come
into the world.
28 And when she had so said, she
went her way, and called Mary her
sister secretly, saying, The Master is
come, and calleth for thee.
29 As soon as she heard that,
she arose quickly, and came unto
him.
30 Now Jesus was not yet come
into the town, but was in that place
where Martha met him.
31 The Jews then which were with
her in the house, and comforted her,
when they saw Mary, that she rose
up hastily and went out, followed
her, saying, She goeth unto the grave
to weep there.
32 Then when Mary was come
where Jesus was, and saw him, she
fell down at his feet, saying unto
him, Lord, if thou hadst been here,
my brother had not died.
33 When Jesus therefore saw her
weeping, and the Jews also weeping
which came with her, he groaned in
the spirit, and was troubled,
34 And said, Where have ye laid
him? They said unto him, Lord,
come and see.
35 Jesus wept.
36 Then said the Jews, Behold how
he a loved him!
37 And some of them said, Could
not this man, which opened the eyes
of the blind, have caused that even
this man should not have died?
38 Jesus therefore again groaning
in himself cometh to the grave. It
was a cave, and a a stone lay upon it.
39 Jesus said, Take ye away the
stone. Martha, the sister of him that
was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by
this time he stinketh: for he hath
been dead four days.
40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not
unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the a glory
of God?
41 Then they took away the stone
from the place where the dead was
laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes,
and said, Father, I a thank thee that
thou hast heard me.
42 And I knew that thou hearest
16a jst John 11:16 . . . him;
for they feared lest the Jews
should take Jesus and put
him to death, for as yet
they did not understand the
power of God.

me always: but because of the people
which stand by I said it, that they
may believe that thou hast a sent me.
43 And when he thus had spoken,
he cried with a loud voice, a Lazarus,
come forth.
44 And he that was a dead came
forth, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and his face was
bound about with a b napkin. Jesus
saith unto them, Loose him, and
let him go.
45 Then many of the Jews which
came to Mary, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed
on him.
46 But some of them went their
ways to the Pharisees, and told them
what things Jesus had done.
47 ¶ Then gathered the chief a priests and the Pharisees a coun- cil, and said, What do we? for this
man doeth many b miracles.
48 If we let him thus alone, all men
will believe on him: and the Romans
shall come and take away both our
place and nation.
49 And one of them, named a Caia- phas, being the b high priest that
same year, said unto them, Ye know
nothing at all,
50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should a die
for the people, and that the whole
nation perish not.
51 And this spake he not of him- self: but being high priest that year,
he prophesied that Jesus should die
for that nation;
52 And not for that nation only,
but that also he should a gather together in one the b children of God
that were scattered abroad.
53 Then from that day forth they
took a counsel together for to put
him to b death.
54 Jesus therefore walked no more
openly among the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to
the wilderness, into a city called
Ephraim, and there continued with
his disciples.
55 ¶ And the Jews’ passover was
nigh at hand: and many went out of
the country up to Jerusalem before
the passover, to a purify themselves.
56 Then sought they for Jesus, and
spake among themselves, as they
stood in the temple, What think ye,
that he will not come to the feast?
57 Now both the chief priests and
the Pharisees had given a command- ment, that, if any man knew where
he were, he should shew it, that they
might take him.
Chapter 12
Mary anoints Jesus’ feet—His trium- phal entry into Jerusalem is recounted—
He foretells His death—To receive
Christ is to receive the Father.
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus
was which had been dead, whom
he raised from the dead.
2 There they made him a supper;
and a Martha served: but Lazarus
was one of them that sat at the table with him.
3 Then took Mary a pound of
ointment of spikenard, very costly,
and anointed the feet of Jesus, and
wiped his feet with her hair: and
the house was filled with the odour
of the ointment.
4 Then saith one of his disciples,
Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which
should betray him,
5 Why was not this ointment sold
for three hundred pence, and given
to the poor?
6 This he said, not that he cared
for the poor; but because he was a

what was put therein.
7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: a against the day of my burying hath
b she kept this.
8 For the poor always ye have with
you; but me ye have not always.
9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
they came not for Jesus’ sake only,
but that they might see Lazarus also,
whom he had raised from the dead.
10 ¶ But the chief priests consulted
that they might put Lazarus also
to death;
11 Because that by reason of him
many of the Jews went away, and
believed on Jesus.
12 ¶ On the next day much people
that were come to the feast, when
they heard that Jesus was coming
to Jerusalem,
13 Took branches of palm trees,
and went forth to meet him, and
cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King
of Israel that cometh in the name
of the Lord.
14 And Jesus, when he had found a
young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: be- hold, thy a King cometh, sitting on
an ass’s colt.
16 These things a understood not
his disciples at the first: but when
Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were
written of him, and that they had
done these things unto him.
17 The people therefore that was
with him when he called Lazarus
out of his grave, and raised him
from the dead, bare record.
18 For this cause the people also a met him, for that they heard that
he had done this b miracle.
19 The Pharisees therefore said
among themselves, Perceive ye how
ye prevail nothing? behold, the
a world is gone after him.
20 ¶ And there were certain a Greeks
among them that came up to b worship at the feast:
21 The same came therefore to
Philip, which was of Bethsaida of
Galilee, and desired him, saying,
Sir, we would see Jesus.
22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
23 ¶ And Jesus answered them,
saying, The a hour is come, that the
Son of man should be b glorified.
24 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Except a a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and b die, it abideth
alone: but if it c die, it bringeth forth
much fruit.
25 He that loveth his a life shall lose
it; and he that b hateth his life in this
world shall keep it unto life eternal.
26 If any man serve me, let him a follow me; and where I am, there
shall also my servant be: if any man
serve me, him will my Father honour.
27 Now is my soul troubled; and
what shall I say ? Father, save me
from this hour: but for this cause
came I unto this hour.
28 Father, glorify thy name. Then
came there a a voice from heaven,
saying, I have both b glorified it, and
will glorify it again.
29 The people therefore, that stood
by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An a angel spake
to him.
30 Jesus answered and said, This
voice came not because of me, but
for your sakes.

32 And I, if I be a lifted up from the
earth, will b draw all men unto me.
33 This he said, signifying what a death he should die.
34 The people answered him,
We have heard out of the law that
a Christ abideth for ever: and how
sayest thou, The Son of man must be
lifted up? who is this Son of man?
35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet
a little while is the a light with you.
Walk while ye have the b light, lest
darkness come upon you: for he that
walketh in c darkness knoweth not
whither he goeth.
36 While ye have light, a believe in
the light, that ye may be the b chil- dren of light. These things spake
Jesus, and departed, and did hide
himself from them.
37 ¶ But though he had done so
many a miracles before them, yet
they b believed not on him:
38 That the saying of Esaias the
prophet might be fulfilled, which
he spake, Lord, who hath a believed
our report? and to whom hath the
arm of the Lord been revealed?
39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
40 He hath a blinded their eyes,
and b hardened their heart; that they
should not see with their eyes, nor
understand with their heart, and be
converted, and I should heal them.
41 These things said Esaias, when
he a saw his b glory, and spake of him.
42 ¶ Nevertheless among the chief
a rulers also many b believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they
did not c confess him, lest they should
be put out of the synagogue:
43 For they loved the a praise of
men more than the praise of God.
44 ¶ Jesus cried and said, He that a believeth on me, believeth not on
me, but on him that sent me.
45 And he that seeth me seeth him
that sent me.
46 I am come a a light into the
world, that whosoever believeth on
me should not abide in darkness.
47 And if any man hear my words,
and believe not, I judge him not: for
I came not to a judge the world, but
to save the world.
48 He that a rejecteth me, and re- ceiveth not my words, hath one that
b judgeth him: the c word that I have
spoken, the same shall d judge him
in the last day.
49 For I have not spoken of myself;
but the Father which a sent me, he
gave me a commandment, what I
should say, and what I should speak.
50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I
a speak therefore, even as the b Father
said unto me, so I c speak.

of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the
world, he b loved them unto the end.
2 And supper being ended, the
devil having now put into the a heart
of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to be- tray him;
3 Jesus a knowing that the Father
had given all b things into his hands,
and that he was c come from God,
and went to God;
4 He riseth from supper, and laid
aside his garments; and took a towel,
and girded himself.
5 After that he poureth water into
a basin, and began to a wash the dis- ciples’ feet, and to wipe them with
the towel wherewith he was girded.
6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter:
and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost
thou wash my feet?
7 Jesus answered and said unto
him, What I do thou knowest not
now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
8 a Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt
never wash my feet. Jesus answered
him, If I b wash thee not, thou hast
no part with me.
9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord,
not my feet only, but also my hands
and my head.
10 Jesus saith to him, He that is
washed needeth not save to wash
his feet, but is a clean every whit:
and ye are b clean, but not all.
11 For he knew who should a be- tray him; therefore said he, Ye are
not b all clean.
12 So after he had washed their
feet, and had taken his garments,
and was set down again, he said
unto them, Know ye what I have
done to you?
13 Ye call me a Master and Lord:
and ye say well; for so I am.
14 If I then, your Lord and a Master, have b washed your feet; ye also
ought to c wash one another’s d feet.
15 For I have given you an a example, that ye should do as I have
done to you.
16 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
The servant is not greater than his
lord; neither he that is sent greater
than he that sent him.
17 If ye know these things, a happy
are ye if ye do them.
18 ¶ I speak not of you all: I know
whom I have chosen: but that the
scripture may be fulfilled, He that
eateth bread with me hath lifted
up his heel against me.
19 Now I tell you before it come,
that, when it is come to pass, ye may
believe that I am a he.
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that receiveth whomsoever I
send a receiveth me; and he that b receiveth me receiveth him that
sent me.
21 When Jesus had thus said, he
was troubled in spirit, and testified,
and said, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, that one of you shall a betray
me.
22 Then the disciples looked one
on another, doubting of whom he
spake.
23 Now there was leaning on Jesus’
bosom one of his a disciples, whom
Jesus loved.
24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned
to him, that he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake.
25 He then lying on Jesus’ breast
saith unto him, Lord, who is it?

26 Jesus answered, He it is, to
whom I shall give a a sop, when I
have dipped it. And when he had
dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon.
27 And after the sop a Satan entered
into him. Then said Jesus unto him,
That thou doest, do quickly.
28 Now no man at the table knew
for what intent he spake this unto
him.
29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the a bag, that Jesus
had said unto him, Buy those things
that we have need of against the
feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
30 He then having received the
sop went immediately out: and it
was night.
31 ¶ Therefore, when he was gone
out, Jesus said, Now is the a Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified
in him.
32 If God be glorified in him,
God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify
him.
33 Little children, yet a little while
I am with you. Ye shall a seek me:
and as I said unto the Jews, Whither
I go, ye cannot come; so now I say
to you.
34 A new commandment I give
unto you, That ye a love one another;
as I have loved you, that ye also b love
one another.
35 By this shall all men know that
ye are my disciples, if ye have a love
one to another.
36 ¶ Simon Peter said unto him,
Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
answered him, Whither I go, thou
canst not follow me now; but thou
shalt follow me afterwards.
37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why
cannot I a follow thee now? I will lay
down my life for thy sake.
38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou
lay down thy life for my sake? Ver- ily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock
shall not crow, till thou hast denied
me thrice.
Chapter 14
Jesus speaks of many mansions—He
says that He is the way, the truth, and
the life and that to see Him is to see
the Father—He promises the first and
second Comforters.
Let not your heart be a troubled: ye
believe in God, believe also in me.
2 In my Father’s a house are many b mansions: if it were not so, I would
have told you. I go to prepare a
place for you.
3 And if I go and prepare a place
for you, I will a come again, and receive you unto myself; that b where c I am, there ye may be also.
4 And whither I go ye know, and
the way ye know.
5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we
know not whither thou goest; and
how can we know the way ?
6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the a way, the b truth, and the life: no
man c cometh unto the Father, but
by me.
7 If ye had a known me, ye should
have known my Father also: and
from henceforth ye know him, and
have seen him.
8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew
us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been
so long time with you, and yet hast
thou not known me, Philip? he that
hath seen me hath seen the a Father;

and how sayest thou then, Shew us
the Father?
10 Believest thou not that I am in
the a Father, and the Father in me?
the words that I speak unto you I
speak not of myself: but the Father
that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
works.
11 Believe me that I am a in the b Father, and the Father in me: or
else believe me for the very works’
sake.
12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that a believeth on me, the works that
I do shall he do also; and greater
works than these shall he do; because I b go unto my c Father.
13 And whatsoever ye shall a ask in
my b name, that will I do, that the
Father may be glorified in the Son.
14 If ye shall ask any thing in my
name, I will do it.
15 ¶ If ye a love me, b keep my c commandments.
16 And I will pray the Father, and
he shall give you another a Com- forter, that he may b abide with you
for ever;
17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom
the world cannot receive, because
it seeth him not, neither knoweth
him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
18 I will not leave you a comfort- less: I will b come to you.
19 Yet a little while, and the world
seeth me no more; but ye see me:
because I live, ye shall live also.
20 At that day ye shall know that
I am in my Father, and ye in me,
and I in you.
21 He that hath my commandments, and a keepeth them, he it is
that loveth me: and he that loveth
me shall be b loved of my Father, and
I will love him, and will c manifest
myself to him.
22 Judas saith unto him, not
Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
wilt manifest thyself unto us, and
not unto the world?
23 Jesus answered and said unto
him, If a man love me, he will keep
my words: and my Father will
a love him, and we will come unto
him, and make our b abode with
him.
24 He that loveth me not keepeth
not my sayings: and the word which
ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s
which sent me.
25 These things have I spoken unto
you, being yet present with you.
26 But the a Comforter, which is the b Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my c name, he shall d teach
you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, whatsoever
I have said unto you.
27 a Peace I leave with you, my b peace I give unto you: not as the
world giveth, give I unto you. Let
not your heart be c troubled, neither
let it be afraid.

you, I go away, and come again
unto you. If ye loved me, ye would

the Father: for my b Father is greater
than I.
29 And now I have told you before
it come to pass, that, when it is come
to pass, ye might a believe.
30 Hereafter I will not talk much
with you: a for the b prince of this c world cometh, and hath nothing
in me.

that I love the Father; and as the

even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
Chapter 15
Jesus is the vine; His disciples are the
branches—He discourses on the perfect
law of love—His servants have been
chosen and ordained by Him—The
world hates and fights true religion—
He promises the Comforter, the Spirit
of Truth.
I am the true a vine, and my Father
is the husbandman.
2 Every a branch in me that beareth
not b fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he c purgeth it, that it may bring forth
more fruit.
3 Now ye are clean through the
word which I have spoken unto you.
4 a Abide in me, and I in you. As
the branch cannot bear fruit of it- self, except it abide in the vine; no
more can ye, except ye abide in me.
5 I am the a vine, ye are the branches:
He that abideth in me, and I in him,
the same bringeth forth much
fruit: for without b me ye can do
nothing.
6 If a man a abide not in me, he
is cast forth as a branch, and is
withered; and men gather them,
and cast them into the fire, and they
are burned.
7 If ye a abide in me, and my words
abide in you, ye shall b ask what ye
will, and it shall be done unto you.
8 Herein is my Father a glorified,
that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye
be my disciples.
9 As the Father hath a loved me,
so have I loved you: continue ye in
my love.
10 If ye a keep my commandments,
ye shall abide in my b love; even as
I have kept my Father’s command- ments, and abide in his love.
11 These things have I spoken unto
you, that my joy might remain in
you, and that your a joy might be full.
12 This is my commandment,
That ye a love one another, as I have b loved you.
13 Greater a love hath no man than
this, that a man lay down his b life
for his c friends.
14 Ye are my a friends, if ye do
whatsoever I b command you.
15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth: but I have
called you a friends; for all things
that I have b heard of my Father I
have made c known unto you.
16 Ye have not chosen me, but I
have a chosen you, and b ordained

you, that ye should go and bring
forth c fruit, and that your fruit
should remain: that whatsoever ye
shall ask of the Father in my d name,
he may give it you.
17 These things I command you,
that ye love one another.
18 If the world a hate you, ye know
that it hated me before it hated you.
19 If ye were of the a world, the
world would b love his own: but be- cause ye are not of the world, but I
have chosen you out of the world,
therefore the world hateth you.
20 Remember the word that I said
unto you, The a servant is not greater
than his lord. If they have b persecuted me, they will also persecute
you; if they have kept my saying,
they will keep yours also.
21 But all these things will they
do unto you for my name’s sake,
because they know not him that
sent me.
22 If I had not come and spoken
unto them, they had not had a sin:
but now they have no b cloak for
their sin.
23 He that hateth me hateth my
Father also.
24 If I had not done among them
the works which none other man
did, they had not had a sin: but now
have they both seen and hated both
me and my Father.
25 But this cometh to pass, that the
word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They a hated me
without a cause.
26 But when the a Comforter is
come, whom I will send unto you
from the Father, even the Spirit of
truth, which proceedeth from the
Father, he shall b testify of me:
27 And ye also shall bear a witness,
because ye have been with me from
the beginning.
Chapter 16
Jesus discourses on the mission of the
Holy Ghost—He tells of His death and
resurrection, announces that He is the
Son of God, and says that He has over- come the world.
These things have I spoken unto
you, that ye should not be a offended.
2 They shall put you out of the
synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
that whosoever a killeth you will
think that he doeth God service.
3 And these things will they do
unto you, because they have not
a known the Father, nor me.
4 But these things have I told you,
that when the time shall come, ye
may remember that I told you of
them. And these things I said not
unto you at the beginning, because
I was with you.
5 But now I a go my way to him
that sent me; and none of you ask- eth me, Whither goest thou?
6 But because I have said these
things unto you, sorrow hath filled
your heart.
7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth;
It is a expedient for you that I go
away: for if I go not away, the b Com- forter will not come unto you; but if
I depart, I will send him unto you.
8 And when he is come, he will a reprove the world of sin, and of
b righteousness, and of judgment:
9 Of a sin, because they believe
not on me;
10 Of righteousness, because I go to
my Father, and ye see me no more;

11 Of judgment, because the prince
of this world is judged.
12 I have yet many things to a say
unto you, but ye cannot b bear them
now.
13 Howbeit when he, the a Spirit of
truth, is come, he will b guide you
into all c truth: for he shall not speak
of himself; but whatsoever he shall
hear, that shall he speak: and he will d shew you things to come.
14 He shall a glorify me: for he shall
receive of mine, and shall shew it
unto you.
15 All a things that the b Father hath
are mine: therefore said I, that he
shall take of mine, and shall shew
it unto you.
16 A little while, and ye shall not
see me: and again, a little while,
and ye shall a see me, because I go
to the Father.
17 Then said some of his disciples
among themselves, What is this that
he saith unto us, A little while, and
ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and,
Because I go to the Father?
18 They said therefore, What is
this that he saith, A little while? we
cannot tell what he saith.
19 Now Jesus knew that they were
desirous to ask him, and said unto
them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while,
and ye shall not see me: and again,
a little while, and ye shall see me?
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
That ye shall weep and lament,
but the world shall rejoice: and
ye shall be sorrowful, but your a sorrow shall be turned into b joy.
21 A a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour
is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth
no more the anguish, for joy that a
man is born into the world.
22 And ye now therefore have a sorrow: but I will see you again, and
your heart shall rejoice, and your
b joy no man taketh from you.
23 And in that day ye shall ask me a nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, Whatsoever ye shall b ask the
Father in my name, he will give it
you.
24 Hitherto have ye asked noth- ing in my name: a ask, and ye shall
receive, that your joy may be full.
25 These things have I spoken
unto you in a proverbs: but the time
cometh, when I shall no more speak
unto you in proverbs, but I shall
shew you plainly of the Father.
26 At that day ye shall ask in my
name: and I say not unto you, that
I will pray the Father for you:
27 For the Father himself a loveth
you, because ye have loved me,
and have b believed that I came out
from God.
28 I a came b forth from the c Father,
and am come into the world: again,
I leave the world, and go to the
Father.
29 His disciples said unto him,
Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
speakest no proverb.
30 Now are we sure that thou a knowest all things, and needest
not that any man should ask thee:
by this we believe that thou camest
forth from God.

Chapter 17
Jesus offers the great Intercessory
Prayer—He is glorified by gaining
eternal life—He prays for His Apostles
and all the Saints—He explains how
the Father and Son are one.
These words spake Jesus, and lifted
up his eyes to heaven, and said,
Father, the hour is come; glorify
thy a Son, that thy Son also may b glorify thee:
2 As thou hast given him a power
over all flesh, that he should give
b eternal life to as many as thou hast
c given him.
3 And this is a life b eternal, that
they might c know thee the only
true d God, and Jesus Christ, whom
thou hast e sent.
4 I have a glorified thee on the earth:
I have b finished the work which
thou gavest me to do.
5 And now, O Father, glorify thou
me with thine own self with the
a glory which I had with thee b before the world was.
6 I have manifested thy name unto
the men which thou gavest me a out
of the world: thine they were, and
thou gavest them me; and they have
kept thy word.
7 Now they have known that all
things whatsoever thou hast a given
me are of thee.
8 For I have given unto them the a words which thou gavest me; and
they have received them, and have
known surely that I b came out from
thee, and they have c believed that
thou didst send me.
9 I a pray for them: I pray not for
the world, but for them which b thou
hast given me; for they are thine.
10 And all mine are thine, and
thine are mine; and I am glorified
in them.
11 And now I am no more in the
world, but these are in the a world,
and I come to thee. Holy Father,
keep through thine own name those
whom thou hast given me, that they
may be b one, as we are.
12 While I was with them in the
world, I kept them in thy name:
those that thou gavest me I have
kept, and a none of them is b lost,
but the son of c perdition; that the
scripture might be fulfilled.
13 And now come I to thee; and

these things I speak in the world,
that they might have my a joy fulfilled in themselves.
14 I have given them thy word; and
the world hath hated them, because
they are not of the world, even as I
am not of the world.
15 I pray not that thou shouldest
take them out of the a world, but
that thou shouldest b keep them
from the c evil.
16 They are not of the a world, even
as I am not of the world.
17 a Sanctify them through thy b truth: thy word is c truth.
18 As thou hast a sent me into the
world, even so have I also sent them
into the world.
19 And for their sakes I a sanctify
myself, that they also might be sanc- tified through the truth.
20 Neither a pray I for these alone,
but for them also which shall b believe on me through their word;
21 That they all may be a one; as
thou, b Father, art in me, and I in
thee, that they also may be c one in
us: that the world may believe that
thou hast sent me.
22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they
may be a one, even as we are b one:
23 I in them, and thou in me, that
they may be made a perfect in one;
and that the world may know that
thou hast sent me, and hast b loved
them, as thou hast loved me.
24 Father, I will that they also,
whom thou hast given me, be with
me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given
me: for thou lovedst me before the
foundation of the world.
25 O righteous Father, the world
hath not a known thee: but I have
known thee, and these have known
that thou hast sent me.
26 And I have a declared unto them
thy b name, and will declare it: that
the c love wherewith thou hast d loved
me may be in them, and I in them.
Chapter 18
Jesus is betrayed and arrested—He is
examined and maltreated first before
Annas, then before Caiaphas—Peter denies knowing Jesus—Jesus is arraigned
before Pilate.
When Jesus had spoken these words,
he went forth with his disciples over
the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and
his disciples.
2 And Judas also, which betrayed
him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
3 Judas then, having received a
band of men and officers from the
chief priests and Pharisees, cometh
thither with lanterns and torches
and weapons.
4 Jesus therefore, knowing all
things that should come upon him,
went forth, and said unto them,
Whom seek ye?
5 They answered him, Jesus of
Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I
am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
6 As soon then as he had said unto
them, I am he, they went backward,
and fell to the ground.
7 Then asked he them again, Whom
seek ye? And they said, Jesus of
Nazareth.
8 Jesus answered, I have told you
that I am he: if therefore ye seek me,
let these go their way:

9 That the saying might be fulfilled,
which he spake, Of them which thou
gavest me have I lost a none.
10 Then Simon Peter having a
sword drew it, and smote the high
priest’s servant, and a cut off his
right ear. The servant’s name was
b Malchus.
11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put
up thy sword into the sheath: the
a cup which my Father hath given
me, shall I not drink it?
12 Then the band and the captain
and officers of the Jews took Jesus,
and bound him,
13 And led him away to a Annas
first; for he was father in law to
Caiaphas, which was the high priest
that same year.
14 Now a Caiaphas was he, which
gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
expedient that one man should die
for the people.
15 ¶ And Simon Peter followed
Jesus, and so did another disciple:
that disciple was known unto the
high priest, and went in with Jesus
into the palace of the high priest.
16 But Peter stood at the door
without. Then went out that other
disciple, which was known unto
the high priest, and spake unto her
that kept the door, and brought in
Peter.
17 Then saith the damsel that kept
the door unto Peter, Art not thou
also one of this man’s disciples? He
saith, I am not.
18 And the servants and officers
stood there, who had made a fire
of coals; for it was cold: and they
warmed themselves: and Peter
stood with them, and warmed
himself.
19 ¶ The high a priest then asked
Jesus of his disciples, and of his
doctrine.
20 Jesus answered him, I spake
openly to the world; I ever taught in
the synagogue, and in the temple,
whither the Jews always resort; and
in secret have I said nothing.
21 Why askest thou me? ask them
which heard me, what I have said
unto them: behold, they know what
I said.
22 And when he had thus spoken,
one of the officers which stood by
a struck Jesus with the palm of his
hand, saying, Answerest thou the
high priest so?
23 Jesus answered him, If I have
spoken evil, bear witness of the evil:
but if well, why smitest thou me?
24 Now Annas had sent him bound
unto Caiaphas the high priest.
25 And Simon Peter stood and
warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one
of his disciples? He denied it, and
said, I am not.
26 One of the servants of the high
priest, being his kinsman whose ear
Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee
in the garden with him?
27 Peter then denied again: and
immediately the cock crew.
28 ¶ Then led they Jesus from Caia- phas unto the hall of judgment: and
it was early; and they themselves
went not into the judgment hall,
lest they should be defiled; but that
they might eat the a passover.
29 a Pilate then went out unto them,
and said, What accusation bring ye
against this man?
30 They answered and said unto
him, If he were not a malefactor,
we would not have delivered him
up unto thee.
31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take
ye him, and judge him according to
your law. The Jews therefore said
unto him, It is not lawful for us to
put any man to death:
32 That the saying of Jesus might
be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
33 Then Pilate entered into the
judgment hall again, and called

Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou
the King of the Jews?
34 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou
this thing of thyself, or did others
tell it thee of me?
35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?
Thine own nation and the chief
priests have delivered thee unto
me: what hast thou done?
36 Jesus answered, My a kingdom is
not of this b world: if my kingdom
were of this world, then would my
servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews: but now is my
kingdom not from hence.
37 a Pilate therefore said unto
him, Art thou a b king then? Jesus
answered, Thou sayest that I am a
c king. To this end was I born, and
for this cause came I into the world,
that I should bear witness unto the
d truth. Every one that is of the truth
heareth my voice.
38 Pilate saith unto him, What is
truth? And when he had a said this,
he went out again unto the Jews,
and saith unto them, I find in him
no b fault at all.
39 But ye have a custom, that I
should release unto you one at the
passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
40 Then cried they all again, say- ing, Not this man, but Barabbas.
Now a Barabbas was a robber.
Chapter 19
Jesus is scourged and crucified—He
places His mother in John’s care—
He dies and His side is pierced with
a spear—He is buried in the tomb of
Joseph of Arimathæa.
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus,
and a scourged him.
2 And the soldiers plaited a crown
of thorns, and put it on his head,
and they put on him a purple robe,
3 And said, Hail, a King of the
Jews! and they smote him with
their hands.
4 Pilate therefore went forth again,
and saith unto them, Behold, I bring
him forth to you, that ye may know
that I find no a fault in him.
5 Then came Jesus forth, wearing
the crown of thorns, and the purple
robe. And Pilate saith unto them,
Behold the man!
6 When the chief priests therefore
and officers saw him, they a cried
out, saying, Crucify him, crucify
him. Pilate saith unto them, Take
ye him, and crucify him: for I find
no b fault in him.
7 The Jews answered him, We have
a a law, and by our law he ought to
die, because he made himself the
b Son of God.
8 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard
that saying, he was the more afraid;
9 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
Whence art thou? But Jesus gave
him no a answer.
10 Then saith Pilate unto him,
Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to
crucify thee, and have power to
release thee?
11 Jesus answered, Thou couldest
have no a power at all against me, ex- cept it were given thee from above:
therefore he that delivered me unto
thee hath the greater b sin.
12 And from thenceforth Pilate
sought to release him: but the Jews
cried out, saying, If thou let this
man go, thou art not Cæsar’s friend:
whosoever maketh himself a a king
speaketh against Cæsar.
13 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard

that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
and sat down in the judgment seat
in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
14 And it was the preparation of
the a passover, and about the sixth
hour: and he saith unto the Jews,
Behold your b King!
15 But they cried out, Away with
him, away with him, a crucify him.
Pilate saith unto them, Shall I cru- cify your King? The chief priests
answered, We have no b king but
Cæsar.
16 Then delivered he him there- fore unto them to be crucified. And
they took Jesus, and led him away.
17 And he a bearing his b cross went
forth into a place called the place of
a c skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
18 Where they crucified him, and
two other with him, on either side
one, and Jesus in the midst.
19 ¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and
put it on the cross. And the writing
was, Jesus of Nazareth the
King of the Jews.
20 This title then read many of
the Jews: for the place where Jesus
was crucified was nigh to the city:
and it was written in Hebrew, and
Greek, and Latin.
21 Then said the chief priests of
the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The
King of the Jews; but that he said,
I am King of the Jews.
22 Pilate answered, What I have
written I have written.
23 ¶ Then the soldiers, when they
had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every
soldier a part; and also his coat: now
the coat was without seam, woven
from the top throughout.
24 They said therefore among
themselves, Let us not rend it, but
cast lots for it, whose it shall be:
that the scripture might be fulfilled,
which saith, They parted my a raiment among them, and for my ves- ture they did cast lots. These things
therefore the soldiers did.
25 ¶ Now there stood by the cross
of Jesus his a mother, and his mother’s
sister, Mary the wife of b Cleophas,
and Mary Magdalene.
26 When Jesus therefore saw his
mother, and the a disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith
unto his mother, b Woman, behold
thy son!
27 Then saith he to the disciple,
Behold thy a mother! And from that
hour that disciple took her unto his
own home.
28 ¶ After this, Jesus knowing that
all things were now accomplished,
that the scripture might be fulfilled,
saith, I thirst.
29 Now there was set a vessel full
of vinegar: and they filled a sponge
with a vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
30 When Jesus therefore had re- ceived the vinegar, he said, It is
a finished: and he bowed his head,
and gave up the ghost.
31 The Jews therefore, because it
was the preparation, that the bodies
should not remain upon the a cross
on the sabbath day, (for that b sab- bath day was an c high d day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be

32 Then came the soldiers, and
brake the legs of the first, and of
the other which was crucified with
him.
33 But when they came to Jesus,
and saw that he was dead already,
they a brake not his legs:
34 But one of the soldiers with a
spear pierced his side, and forthwith
came there out blood and water.
35 And he that a saw it bare b record,
and his record is true: and he
knoweth that he saith true, that ye

36 For these things were done, that
the scripture should be fulfilled, A
a bone of him shall not be broken.
37 And again another scripture
saith, They shall look on him whom
they a pierced.
38 ¶ And after this a Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus,
but secretly for b fear of the Jews,
besought Pilate that he might take
away the body of Jesus: and Pilate
gave him leave. He came therefore,
and took the body of Jesus.
39 And there came also a Nicode- mus, which at the first came to Jesus
by night, and brought a mixture of
b myrrh and aloes, about an hundred
pound weight.
40 Then took they the body of
Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
with the spices, as the manner of
the Jews is to bury.
41 Now in the place where he was
crucified there was a garden; and
in the garden a new a sepulchre,
wherein was never man yet laid.
42 There laid they Jesus therefore
because of the Jews’ a preparation day;
for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
Chapter 20
Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John find
the empty tomb—The risen Christ ap- pears to Mary Magdalene in the garden—He appears to the disciples and
shows His resurrected body—Thomas
feels the wounds in Jesus’ hands, feet,
and side—Jesus is the Christ, the Son
of God.
The a first day of the week cometh
Mary Magdalene early, when it was
yet b dark, unto the sepulchre, and
seeth the c stone taken away from
the d sepulchre.
2 Then she runneth, and cometh to
Simon Peter, and to the other a disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith
unto them, They have taken away the
b Lord out of the sepulchre, and we
know not where they have laid him.
3 Peter therefore went forth, and
that other disciple, and came to the
sepulchre.
4 So they ran both together: and
the other disciple did outrun Peter,
and came first to the sepulchre.
5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying;
yet went he not in.
6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
7 And the a napkin, that was about
his head, not lying with the linen
clothes, but wrapped together in a
place by itself.
8 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
9 For as yet they knew not the
scripture, that he must a rise again
from the b dead.
10 Then the disciples went away
again unto their own home.

11 ¶ But Mary stood without at
the sepulchre weeping: and as she
wept, she stooped down, and looked
into the sepulchre,
12 And seeth two a angels in white
sitting, the one at the head, and the
other at the feet, where the body of
Jesus had lain.
13 And they say unto her, Woman,
why weepest thou? She saith unto
them, Because they have taken away
my Lord, and I know not where they
have laid him.
14 And when she had thus said,
she turned herself back, and a saw
Jesus standing, and knew not that
it was Jesus.
15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman,
why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou? She, supposing him to be
the gardener, saith unto him, Sir,
if thou have borne him hence, tell
me where thou hast laid him, and
I will take him away.
16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She
turned herself, and saith unto him,
Rabboni; which is to say, a Master.
17 Jesus saith unto her, a Touch me
not; for I am not yet b ascended to
my c Father: but go to my brethren,
and say unto them, I ascend unto
my d Father, and your Father; and
to my God, and your God.
18 Mary Magdalene came and told
the disciples that she had seen the
Lord, and that he had spoken these
things unto her.
19 ¶ Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
when the doors were shut where the
disciples were a assembled for fear
of the Jews, came Jesus and b stood
in the midst, and saith unto them,
c Peace be unto you.
20 And when he had so said, he
shewed unto them his a hands and
his side. Then were the disciples
glad, when they b saw the Lord.
21 Then said Jesus to them again,
Peace be unto you: as my a Father
hath b sent me, even so c send I you.
22 And when he had said this, he
breathed on them, and saith unto
them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
23 Whose soever sins ye a remit,
they are remitted unto them; and
whose soever sins ye retain, they
are retained.
24 ¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve,
called Didymus, was not with them
when Jesus came.
25 The other disciples therefore
said unto him, We have seen the
Lord. But he said unto them, Except
I shall see in his hands the a print
of the nails, and put my finger into
the print of the nails, and thrust my
hand into his side, I will not believe.
26 ¶ And after eight days again his
disciples were within, and Thomas
with them: then came Jesus, the doors
being shut, and stood in the midst,
and said, Peace be unto you.
27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach
hither thy finger, and behold my
hands; and reach hither thy hand,
and a thrust it into my side: and be
not b faithless, but c believing.
28 And Thomas answered and said
unto him, My Lord and my God.
29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas,
because thou hast a seen me, thou
hast believed: b blessed are they that
have not seen, and yet have c believed.

30 ¶ And many other a signs truly
did Jesus in the presence of his
disciples, which are not b written
in this book:
31 But these are a written, that
ye might b believe that Jesus is the c Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have d life through

Chapter 21
Jesus appears to the disciples at the sea
of Tiberias—He says, Feed my sheep—
He foretells Peter’s martyrdom and that
John will not die.
After these things Jesus a shewed
himself again to the disciples at the
sea of Tiberias; and on this wise
shewed he himself.
2 There were together Simon Peter,
and Thomas called Didymus, and
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and
the sons of a Zebedee, and two other
of his disciples.
3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I
go a fishing. They say unto him, We
also go with thee. They went forth,
and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught
nothing.
4 But when the morning was now
come, Jesus a stood on the shore:
but the disciples knew not that it
was Jesus.
5 Then Jesus saith unto them,
Children, have ye any meat? They
answered him, No.
6 And he said unto them, Cast the
net on the right side of the ship, and
ye shall find. They cast therefore,
and now they were not able to draw
it for the multitude of fishes.
7 Therefore that disciple whom
Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is
the Lord. Now when Simon Peter
heard that it was the Lord, he girt
his fisher’s coat unto him, (for he
was naked,) and did cast himself
into the sea.
8 And the other disciples came
in a little ship; (for they were not
far from land, but as it were two
hundred cubits,) dragging the net
with fishes.
9 As soon then as they were come to
land, they saw a fire of coals there,
and fish laid thereon, and bread.
10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of
the fish which ye have now caught.
11 Simon Peter went up, and drew
the net to land full of great fishes,
an hundred and fifty and three: and
for all there were so many, yet was
not the net broken.
12 Jesus saith unto them, Come
and dine. And none of the disciples
durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh
bread, and giveth them, and fish
likewise.
14 This is now the a third time that
Jesus b shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from
the dead.
15 ¶ So when they had dined,
Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,
son of Jonas, lovest thou me more
than these? He saith unto him,
Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love
thee. He saith unto him, Feed my
lambs.
16 He saith to him again the sec- ond time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him,
Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love
thee. He saith unto him, a Feed my
sheep.
17 He saith unto him the third
time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
thou me? Peter was grieved be- cause he said unto him the third
time, Lovest thou me? And he said

18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither
thou wouldest: but when thou shalt
be a old, thou shalt stretch forth thy
hands, and another shall gird thee,
and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
19 This spake he, signifying by
what a death he should glorify God.
And when he had spoken this, he
saith unto him, Follow me.
20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth
the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his
breast at supper, and said, Lord,
which is he that betrayeth thee?
21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus,
Lord, and what shall this man do?
22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will
that he a tarry till I come, what is
that to thee? b follow thou me.
23 Then went this saying abroad
among the brethren, that that disciple should not a die: yet Jesus said
not unto him, He shall not die; but,
If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee?
24 This is the a disciple which testifieth of these things, and b wrote
these things: and we know that his
testimony is c true.

things which Jesus did, the which, if
they should be a written every one,
I suppose that even the world itself
could not contain the b books that
should be written. Amen.

THE ACTS
OF THE APOSTLES
CHAPTER 1
Jesus ministers for forty days after His
resurrection—The kingdom is to be
restored to Israel at a later time—The
Twelve are to bear witness in Jerusa- lem, Judæa, Samaria, and the uttermost
parts of the earth—Jesus ascends into
heaven—Matthias is chosen to fill the
vacancy in the Twelve.
THE former treatise have a  I
made, O b  Theophilus, of all
that Jesus began both to do
and teach,
2 Until the day in which he was
taken up, after that he through the
Holy Ghost had given a commandments unto the apostles whom he
had chosen:
3 To whom also he a shewed himself 
Acts 1:4–20 1366
alive after his b passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them
forty days, and speaking of the things
c pertaining to the kingdom of God:
4 And, being assembled together
with them, commanded them that
they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the a promise of
the Father, which, saith he, ye have
heard of me.
5 For John truly baptized with wa- ter; but ye shall be a baptized with
the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
6 When they therefore were come
together, they asked of him, saying,
Lord, wilt thou at this time a restore
again the kingdom to Israel?
7 And he said unto them, It is not
for you to know the times or the
a seasons, which the Father hath put
in his own power.
8 But ye shall receive a power, after
that the Holy Ghost is come upon
you: and ye shall be b witnesses unto
me both in Jerusalem, and in all
Judæa, and in c Samaria, and unto
the uttermost part of the earth.
9 And when he had spoken these
things, while they beheld, he was
a taken b up; and a cloud received
him out of their sight.
10 And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up,
behold, two men stood by them in
white apparel;
11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
a heaven? this same Jesus, which is
b taken up from you into heaven,
shall so c come in like d manner as
ye have seen him go into heaven.
12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
which is from Jerusalem a sabbath
day’s journey.
13 And when they were come in,
they went up into an upper room,
where abode both Peter, and James,
and John, and Andrew, Philip, and
Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphæus, and
Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother
of James.
14 These all continued with a one
accord in prayer and b supplication,
with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his c brethren.
15 ¶ And in those days Peter stood
up in the midst of the disciples, and
said, (the number of names together
were about an hundred and twenty,)
16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,
which the Holy Ghost by the mouth
of David a spake before concerning b Judas, which was guide to them
that took Jesus.
17 For he was numbered with
us, and had obtained part of this
ministry.
18 Now this man purchased a field
with the reward of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he a burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels
gushed out.
19 And it was known unto all the
dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as
that field is called in their a proper
tongue, Aceldama, that is to say,
The field of blood.
20 For it is written in the book of
Psalms, Let his habitation be a deso- late, and let no man dwell therein:
and his b bishoprick let another take.

21 Wherefore of these men which
have companied with us all the time
that the Lord Jesus went in and out
among us,
22 Beginning from the baptism
of John, unto that same day that
he was taken up from us, must one
a be ordained to be a b witness with
us of his c resurrection.
23 And they appointed two, Joseph
called Barsabas, who was surnamed
Justus, and Matthias.
24 And they a prayed, and said,
Thou, Lord, which b knowest the
hearts of all men, shew c whether of
these two thou hast d chosen,
25 That he may take part of this
ministry and a apostleship, from
which Judas by transgression b fell,
that he might go to his own place.
26 And they gave forth their lots;
and the lot fell upon a Matthias; and
he was numbered with the eleven
apostles.
Chapter 2
The Spirit is poured out on the day of
Pentecost—Peter testifies of Jesus’ resurrection—He tells how to gain salvation and speaks of the gift of the Holy
Ghost—Many believe and are baptized.
And when the day of a Pentecost was
fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place.
2 And suddenly there came a sound
from heaven as of a rushing mighty
a wind, and it filled all the house
where they were sitting.
3 And there appeared unto them a cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.
4 And they were all filled with the a Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other b tongues, as the c Spirit
gave them utterance.
5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.
6 Now when this was noised abroad,
the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his
own a language.
7 And they were all amazed and
marvelled, saying one to another,
Behold, are not all these which
speak Galilæans?
8 And how hear we every man in
our own tongue, wherein we were
born?
9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elam- ites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judæa, and Cappadocia,
in Pontus, and Asia,
10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in
Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
about Cyrene, and strangers of
Rome, Jews and a proselytes,
11 Cretes and Arabians, we do
hear them speak in our a tongues
the wonderful works of God.
12 And they were all amazed, and
were in doubt, saying one to another,
What meaneth this?
13 Others a mocking said, These
men are full of new wine.
14 ¶ But Peter, standing up with
the eleven, lifted up his voice, and
said unto them, Ye men of Judæa,
and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be
this known unto you, and hearken
to my words:
15 For these are not drunken, as
ye suppose, seeing it is but the third
hour of the day.
16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet a Joel;
17 And it shall come to pass in the a last days, saith God, I will b pour out
of my c Spirit upon all flesh: and your

18 And on my servants and on
my handmaidens I will pour out in
those days of my Spirit; and they
shall a prophesy:
19 And I will shew a wonders in
heaven above, and b signs in the
earth beneath; blood, and fire, and

20 The sun shall be turned into a darkness, and the moon into blood,
before that great and b notable c day
of the Lord come:
21 And it shall come to pass, that
whosoever shall call on the name
of the Lord shall be a saved.
22 Ye men of Israel, hear these
words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
a approved of God among you by
b miracles and wonders and signs,
which c God did by him in the
midst of you, as ye yourselves also
know:
23 Him, being delivered by the a determinate counsel and b fore- knowledge of God, ye have taken,
and by wicked hands have c cruci- fied and slain:
24 Whom God hath a raised up,
having loosed the b pains of c death:
because it was not possible that he
should be holden of it.
25 For David speaketh concern- ing him, I foresaw the a Lord al- ways before my face, for he is on
my right hand, that I should not be
moved:
26 Therefore did my heart rejoice,
and my tongue was glad; moreover
also my flesh shall rest in hope:
27 Because thou wilt not leave
my soul in a hell, neither wilt
thou suffer thine Holy One to see
b corruption.
28 Thou hast made known to me
the ways of life; thou shalt make me
full of joy with thy countenance.
29 Men and brethren, let me freely
speak unto you of the a patriarch
David, that he is both dead and
b buried, and his sepulchre is with
us unto this day.
30 Therefore being a prophet, and
knowing that God had sworn with
an a oath to him, that of the fruit
of his loins, according to the flesh,
he would raise up b Christ to sit on
his throne;
31 He seeing this before spake of
the resurrection of Christ, that his
soul was not left in hell, neither his
flesh did see corruption.
32 This Jesus hath God a raised up,
whereof we all are b witnesses.
33 Therefore being a by the b right
hand of God c exalted, and having
received of the Father the promise
of the Holy Ghost, he hath d shed
forth this, which ye now see and
hear.
34 For a David is not b ascended into
the heavens: but he saith himself,
The Lord said unto my c Lord, Sit
thou on my right hand,
35 Until I make thy foes thy foot- stool.
36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath
made that same Jesus, whom ye

37 ¶ Now when they heard this,
they were a pricked in their b heart,
and said unto Peter and to the rest
of the apostles, Men and brethren, c what shall we do?
38 Then Peter a said unto them, b Repent, and be c baptized every one of
you in the d name of Jesus Christ for
the e remission of sins, and ye shall
receive the f gift of the g Holy Ghost.
39 For the a promise is unto you,
and to your children, and to all
that are b afar off, even as many as
the Lord our God shall call.
40 And with many other words
did he testify and exhort, saying,
a Save yourselves from this b unto- ward generation.
41 ¶ Then they that gladly a re- ceived his b word were baptized: and
the same day there were added unto
them about c three thousand souls.
42 And they continued a steadfastly
in the apostles’ doctrine and b fel- lowship, and in breaking of c bread,
and in prayers.
43 And a fear came upon every soul:
and many wonders and b signs were
done by the apostles.
44 And all that believed were together, and had all things a common;
45 And sold their possessions and
goods, and parted them to all men,
as every man had a need.
46 And they, continuing daily with
one accord in the a temple, and
breaking bread from house to house,
did eat their meat with gladness
and b singleness of heart,
47 Praising God, and having favour
with all the people. And the Lord
a added to the b church daily such as
should be saved.
Chapter 3
Peter and John heal a man lame since
birth—Peter preaches repentance—He
also speaks of the age of restoration preceding the Second Coming—He iden- tifies Christ as the prophet of whom
Moses spoke.
Now Peter and John went up to- gether into the temple at the hour
of prayer, being the ninth hour.
2 And a certain man a lame from his
mother’s womb was carried, whom
they laid daily at the gate of the
temple which is called Beautiful,
to ask alms of them that entered
into the temple;
3 Who seeing Peter and John about
to go into the temple asked an a alms.
4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon
him with John, said, Look on us.
5 And he gave heed unto them,
expecting to receive something of
them.
6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold
have I none; but such as I have a give
I thee: In the b name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth rise up and walk.
7 And he took him by the right
hand, and a lifted him up: and im- mediately his feet and ankle bones
received strength.

8 And he leaping up stood, and
walked, and entered with them into
the temple, walking, and leaping,
and praising God.
9 And all the people a saw him
walking and praising God:
10 And they knew that it was he
which sat for alms at the Beautiful
gate of the temple: and they were
filled with wonder and amazement
at that which had happened unto
him.
11 And as the lame man which was
healed held Peter and John, all the
people ran together unto them in
the a porch that is called Solomon’s,
greatly wondering.
12 ¶ And when Peter saw it, he
answered unto the people, Ye men
of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or
why look ye so earnestly on us, as
though by our a own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
13 The God of Abraham, and of
Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
fathers, hath a glorified his Son
Jesus; whom ye b delivered up, and c denied him in the presence of
Pilate, when he was determined to let
him go.
14 But ye denied the Holy One and
the Just, and desired a a murderer
to be granted unto you;
15 And killed the a Prince of life,
whom God hath b raised from the
dead; whereof we are c witnesses.
16 And his a name through faith
in his name hath made this man
strong, whom ye see and know: yea,
the b faith which is by him hath given
him this perfect soundness in the
presence of you all.
17 And now, brethren, a I b wot that
through c ignorance ye did it, as did
also your rulers.
18 But those things, which God before had a shewed by the mouth of
all his b prophets, that Christ should c suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
19 ¶ a Repent ye therefore, and be b converted, that your sins may be
c blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the d presence of the Lord;
20 And he shall send a Jesus Christ,
which before was preached unto
b you:
21 Whom the heaven must receive
until the times of a restitution of all
things, which God hath b spoken by
the mouth of all his holy prophets
since the world began.
22 For Moses truly said unto the
fathers, A a prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you of your
brethren, like unto me; him shall
ye hear in all things whatsoever he
shall say unto you.
23 And it shall come to pass, that
every soul, which will not hear that
prophet, shall be a destroyed from
among the people.
24 Yea, and all the prophets from
Samuel and those that follow after,
as many as have spoken, have likewise a foretold of these days.

God made with our fathers, saying
unto Abraham, And in thy seed
shall all the kindreds of the earth
be c blessed.

raised up his a Son Jesus, sent him
to bless you, in turning away every
one of you from his iniquities.
Chapter 4
Peter and John are arrested and brought
before the council—Peter testifies that
salvation comes because of Christ—
The Sadducees strive to silence Peter
and John—The Saints glory in the testimony of Jesus—They have all things
in common.
And as they spake unto the people,
the priests, and the captain of the
temple, and the Sadducees, came
upon them,
2 Being grieved that they taught the
people, and preached through Jesus
the a resurrection from the dead.
3 And they laid hands on them,
and put them in hold unto the next
day: for it was now eventide.
4 Howbeit many of them which
heard the word believed; and the
number of the men was about a five
thousand.
5 ¶ And it came to pass on the
morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and a scribes,
6 And Annas the high priest, and
Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander,
and as many as were of the kindred
of the high a priest, were gathered
together at Jerusalem.
7 And when they had set them
in the midst, they asked, By what
a power, or by what b name, have ye
done this?
8 Then Peter, filled with the a Holy
Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of
the people, and elders of Israel,
9 If we this day be examined of the
good deed done to the impotent man,
by what means he is made whole;
10 Be it known unto you all, and
to all the people of Israel, that by
the a name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God
raised from the dead, even by him
doth this man stand here before
you whole.
11 This is the a stone which was set
at nought of you builders, which is
become the head of the corner.
12 Neither is there a salvation in
any other: for there is none other
b name under heaven given among
men, whereby we must be c saved.
13 ¶ Now when they saw the bold- ness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were a unlearned
and b ignorant men, they marvelled;
and they took knowledge of them,
that they had been with Jesus.
14 And beholding the man which
was healed standing with them, they
could say nothing against it.
15 But when they had commanded
them to go aside out of the council,
they conferred among themselves,
16 Saying, What shall we do to
these men? for that indeed a notable
a miracle hath been done by them is
manifest to all them that dwell in
Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
17 But that it spread no further
among the people, let us straitly
threaten them, that they speak
henceforth to no man in this name.
18 And they called them, and a commanded them not to speak at
all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

and said unto them, Whether it be

right in the sight of God to a hearken

20 For we cannot but a speak the
things which we have b seen and
heard.
21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish
them, because of the people: for all
men glorified God for that which
was done.
22 For the man was above forty
years old, on whom this miracle of
healing was shewed.
23 ¶ And being let go, they went
to their own company, and reported
all that the chief priests and elders
had said unto them.
24 And when they heard that, they
lifted up their voice to God with one
accord, and said, Lord, thou art God,
which hast made heaven, and a earth,
and the sea, and all that in them is:
25 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
26 The a kings of the earth stood
up, and the rulers were gathered to- gether against the Lord, and against
his Christ.
27 For of a truth against thy holy
child Jesus, whom thou hast a anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate,
with the Gentiles, and the people
of Israel, were gathered together,
28 For to do whatsoever thy hand
and thy counsel determined before
to be done.
29 And now, Lord, behold their
threatenings: and grant unto thy
servants, that with all boldness they
may speak thy word,
30 By stretching forth thine hand
to heal; and that signs and wonders
may be done by the name of thy
holy child Jesus.
31 ¶ And when they had prayed,
the place was shaken where they
were a assembled together; and
they were all filled with the b Holy
Ghost, and they spake the word of
God with boldness.
32 And the multitude of them that
believed were of a one heart and of
one soul: neither said any of them
that b ought of the things which he c possessed was his own; but they
had all things d common.
33 And with great power gave the
apostles a witness of the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus: and great b grace
was upon them all.
34 Neither was there any among
them that lacked: for as many as
were possessors of lands or houses
a sold them, and brought the prices
of the things that were sold,
35 And laid them down at the
apostles’ feet: and a distribution was
made unto every man according as
he had b need.
36 And Joses, who by the apostles
was surnamed a Barnabas, (which
is, being interpreted, The son of
consolation,) a Levite, and of the
country of Cyprus,
37 Having land, sold it, and brought
the a money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

But a certain man named Ananias,
with Sapphira his wife, a sold a possession,
2 And a kept back b part of the price,
his wife also being privy to it, and
brought a certain c part, and laid it
at the apostles’ feet.
3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath
Satan filled thine heart to a lie to the
Holy Ghost, and to b keep back part
of the price of the land?
4 Whiles it remained, was it not
thine own? and after it was sold, was
it not in thine own power? why hast
thou conceived this thing in thine
heart? thou hast not a lied unto men,
but unto b God.
5 And Ananias hearing these words
fell down, and a gave up the ghost:
and great fear came on all them
that heard these things.
6 And the young men arose, wound
him up, and carried him out, and
buried him.
7 And it was about the space of
three hours after, when his wife, not
knowing what was done, came in.
8 And Peter answered unto her,
Tell me whether ye sold the land
for so much? And she said, Yea, for
so much.
9 Then Peter said unto her, How
is it that ye have agreed together to
a tempt the Spirit of the Lord? be- hold, the feet of them which have
buried thy husband are at the door,
and shall carry thee out.
10 Then fell she down a straight- way at his feet, and yielded up the
ghost: and the young men came in,
and found her dead, and, carrying
her forth, buried her by her husband.
11 And great fear came upon all
the church, and upon as many as
heard these things.
12 ¶ And by the hands of the apos- tles were many a signs and wonders
wrought among the people; (and
they were all with one accord in
Solomon’s porch.
13 And of the a rest durst no man
join himself to them: but the peo- ple magnified them.
14 And believers were the more a added to the Lord, multitudes both
of men and women.)
15 Insomuch that they brought
forth the sick into the streets, and
laid them on beds and couches, that
at the least the a shadow of Peter
passing by might overshadow some
of them.
16 There came also a multitude out
of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them
which were vexed with unclean spir- its: and they were a healed every one.
17 ¶ Then the high priest rose up,
and all they that were with him,
(which is the sect of the Sadducees,)
and were filled with a indignation,
18 And laid their hands on the
apostles, and put them in the common prison.
19 But the a angel of the Lord by
night opened the b prison doors, and
brought them forth, and said,
20 Go, stand and speak in the
temple to the people all the a words
of this life.
21 And when they heard that, they
entered into the temple early in the
morning, and taught. But the high
priest came, and they that were with
him, and called the council together,
and all the senate of the children
of Israel, and sent to the prison to
have them brought.
22 But when the officers came, and
found them not in the prison, they
returned, and told,
23 Saying, The prison truly found
we shut with all safety, and the
keepers standing without before the

doors: but when we had opened, we
found no man within.
24 Now when the high priest and
the captain of the temple and the
chief priests heard these things,
they doubted of them whereunto
this would grow.
25 Then came one and told them,
saying, Behold, the men whom ye
put in prison are standing in the
temple, and teaching the people.
26 Then went the captain with the
officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the
people, lest they should have been
stoned.
27 And when they had brought
them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,
28 Saying, Did not we straitly a command you that ye should not
teach in this b name? and, behold,
ye have filled Jerusalem with your
doctrine, and intend to bring this
man’s c blood upon us.
29 ¶ Then Peter and the other apos- tles answered and said, We ought to
a obey God rather than men.
30 The God of our fathers raised
up Jesus, whom ye slew and a hanged
on a tree.
31 Him hath God exalted a with
his right hand to be a b Prince and a c Saviour, for to give repentance to
Israel, and d forgiveness of sins.
32 And we are his a witnesses of
these things; and so is also the b Holy
Ghost, whom God hath c given to
them that obey him.
33 ¶ When they heard that, they
were a cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.
34 Then stood there up one in the
council, a Pharisee, named a Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in
reputation among all the people,
and commanded to put the apostles
forth a little space;
35 And said unto them, Ye men
of Israel, take heed to yourselves
what ye intend to do as touching
these men.
36 For before these days rose up
Theudas, boasting himself to be
somebody; to whom a number of
men, about four hundred, joined
themselves: who was slain; and all,
as many as a obeyed him, were scat- tered, and brought to nought.
37 After this man rose up Judas
of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people
after him: he also perished; and all,
even as many as obeyed him, were
dispersed.
38 And now I say unto you, a Re- frain from these men, and let them
alone: for if this counsel or this work
be of b men, it will come to nought:
39 But if it be of God, ye cannot
overthrow it; a lest haply ye be found
even to b fight against God.
40 And to him they agreed: and
when they had called the apostles,
and beaten them, they commanded
that they should not speak in the
name of Jesus, and let them go.
41 ¶ And they departed from the
presence of the council, a rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to
b suffer c shame for his d name.
42 And daily in the temple, and
in every house, they ceased not to
teach and a preach Jesus Christ.

The Apostles choose seven to assist
them—Stephen is tried before the
council.
And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied,
there arose a murmuring of the Gre- cians against the Hebrews, because
their a widows were b neglected in
the daily c ministration.
2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,
and said, It is not reason that we
should leave the word of God, and
serve tables.
3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out
among you seven men of a honest b report, full of the Holy Ghost and
c wisdom, whom we may appoint
over this d business.
4 But we will give ourselves con- tinually to prayer, and to the a ministry of the word.
5 ¶ And the saying pleased the
whole multitude: and they a chose
Stephen, a man full of faith and of
the b Holy Ghost, and c Philip, and
Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon,
and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they
a laid their b hands on them.
7 And the word of God increased;
and the number of the disciples
multiplied in Jerusalem greatly;
and a great company of the a priests
were obedient to the faith.
8 And Stephen, full of faith and a power, did great wonders and
b miracles among the people.
9 ¶ Then there arose certain of
the synagogue, which is called the
synagogue of the a Libertines, and
Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and
of them of Cilicia and of Asia, b disputing with Stephen.
10 And they were not able to resist the a wisdom and the spirit by
which he spake.
11 Then they suborned men, which
said, We have heard him speak a blasphemous words against Moses, and
against God.
12 And they stirred up the people,
and the elders, and the scribes, and
came upon him, and caught him, and
brought him to the council,
13 And set up a false witnesses,
which said, This man ceaseth not to
speak blasphemous words against
this holy place, and the law:
14 For we have heard him say, that
this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
this place, and shall change the
a customs which Moses delivered us.
15 And all that sat in the council,
looking steadfastly on him, saw his
face as it had been the a face of an b angel.
Chapter 7
Stephen recounts the history of Israel
and names Moses as a prototype of
Christ—He testifies of the apostasy in
Israel—He sees Jesus on the right hand
of God—Stephen’s testimony is rejected,
and he is stoned to death.
Then said the high priest, Are these
things so?
2 And he said, Men, brethren, and
fathers, hearken; The God of glory
appeared unto our father a Abraham,

and come into the land which I

4 Then came he out of the land
of the a Chaldæans, and dwelt in
Charran: and from thence, when his
father was dead, he removed him
into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set
his foot on: yet he a promised that
he would give it to him for a pos- session, and to his seed after him,
when as yet he had no child.
6 And God spake on this wise,
That his seed should a sojourn in a
strange land; and that they should
bring them into b bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.
7 And the nation to whom they
shall be in bondage will I judge,
said God: and after that shall they
come forth, and serve me in this
place.
8 And he gave him the covenant of a circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the
eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and
Jacob begat the twelve b patriarchs.
9 And the patriarchs, moved with a envy, sold b Joseph into Egypt: but
God was with him,
10 And a delivered him out of all
his b afflictions, and gave him favour
and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh
king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
11 Now there came a a dearth over
all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,
and great affliction: and our fathers
found no sustenance.
12 But when Jacob heard that there
was a corn in Egypt, he sent out our
fathers first.
13 And at the second time a Joseph
was made known to his brethren;
and Joseph’s kindred was made
known unto b Pharaoh.
14 Then sent a Joseph, and called
his b father c Jacob to him, and all his
kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
15 So Jacob went down into Egypt,
and died, he, and our fathers,
16 And were carried over into
Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
that Abraham a bought for a sum
of money of the sons of Emmor the
father of Sychem.
17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn
to Abraham, the people grew and
multiplied in Egypt,
18 Till another a king arose, which
knew not Joseph.
19 The same dealt subtilly with
our kindred, and evil entreated our
fathers, so that they cast out their
young children, to the end they
might not live.
20 In which time Moses was born,
and was a exceeding fair, and nour- ished up in his father’s house b three
months:
21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and
nourished him for her own a son.
22 And Moses was a learned in all
the wisdom of the Egyptians, and
was mighty in words and in deeds.
23 And when he was full a forty
years old, it came into his heart to
visit his b brethren the children of
Israel.
24 And seeing one of them suf- fer wrong, he defended him, and
avenged him that was a oppressed,
and b smote the Egyptian:
25 For he supposed his brethren
would have a understood how that

God by his hand would b deliver
them: but they understood not.
26 And the next day he shewed
himself unto them as they strove,
and would have set them at one
again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren;
why do ye a wrong one to another?
27 But he that did his neighbour
wrong thrust him away, saying,
Who made thee a a ruler and a judge
over us?
28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday ?
29 Then a fled Moses at this saying,
and was a stranger in the land of
Madian, where he begat two b sons.
30 And when forty years were ex- pired, there appeared to him in the
wilderness of mount Sina an a angel
of the Lord in a flame of fire in a
bush.
31 When Moses saw it, he wondered
at the a sight: and as he drew near
to behold it, the b voice of the Lord
came unto him,
32 Saying, I am the a God of thy
fathers, the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and
durst not behold.
33 Then said the Lord to him, Put
off thy shoes from thy feet: for the
place where thou standest is holy
ground.
34 I have seen, I have seen the af- fliction of my people which is in
Egypt, and I have heard their groan- ing, and am come down to deliver
them. And now come, I will send
thee into Egypt.
35 This Moses whom they refused,
saying, Who made thee a ruler and
a judge? the same did God send to
be a ruler and a a deliverer by the
hand of the angel which appeared
to him in the bush.
36 He a brought them out, after that
he had shewed wonders and signs
in the land of Egypt, and in the
Red sea, and in the wilderness forty
years.
37 ¶ This is that Moses, which
said unto the children of Israel, A
a prophet shall the Lord your God
raise up unto you of your brethren,
like unto me; him shall ye hear.
38 This is he, that was in the
church in the wilderness with the

mount Sina, and with our fathers:
who received the lively a oracles to
give unto us:
39 To whom our fathers would not a obey, but thrust him from them, and
in their hearts turned back again
into Egypt,
40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us a gods to go before us: for as for this
Moses, which brought us out of the
land of Egypt, we wot not what is
become of him.
41 And they made a a calf in those
days, and offered sacrifice unto the
idol, and rejoiced in the works of
their own hands.
42 Then God turned, and a gave
them up to worship the host of
heaven; as it is written in the book
of the prophets, O ye house of Israel,
have ye offered to me slain beasts
and sacrifices by the space of forty
years in the wilderness?
43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle
of Moloch, and the star of your god
Remphan, figures which ye made
to worship them: and I will carry
you away beyond Babylon.
44 Our fathers had the tabernacle
of witness in the wilderness, as he
had appointed, speaking unto Moses,
that he should make it according to
the a fashion that he had seen.

came after brought in with a Jesus

into the possession of the Gentiles,
whom God drave out before the
face of our fathers, unto the days
of David;
46 Who found favour before God,
and desired to find a tabernacle for
the God of Jacob.
47 But Solomon built him an house.
48 Howbeit the most High a dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
as saith the prophet,
49 Heaven is my a throne, and earth
is my footstool: what house will ye
build me? saith the Lord: or what
is the place of my rest?
50 Hath not my hand a made all
these things?
51 ¶ Ye a stiffnecked and b uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
always c resist the d Holy Ghost: as
your e fathers did, so do ye.
52 Which of the prophets have not
your fathers a persecuted? and they
have slain them which shewed be- fore of the coming of the Just One;
of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
53 Who have received the law by
the disposition of a angels, and have
not b kept it.
54 ¶ When they heard these things,
they were a cut to the heart, and they
gnashed on him with their teeth.
55 But he, being full of the a Holy
Ghost, looked up steadfastly into
heaven, and saw the b glory of c God,
and d Jesus e standing on the f right
hand of God,
56 And said, Behold, I a see the heavens b opened, and the c Son of man
standing on the right d hand of e God.
57 Then they cried out with a loud
voice, and stopped their ears, and
ran upon him with one accord,
58 And cast him out of the city,
and stoned him: and the witnesses
laid down their a clothes at a b young
man’s feet, whose name was Saul.
59 And they a stoned b Stephen, c calling upon d God, and saying, Lord
Jesus, receive my e spirit.

not this sin to their c charge. And
when he had said this, he fell asleep.

Saul persecutes the Church—Philip’s
ministry in Samaria is described—Philip performs miracles and baptizes men
and women—Peter and John come to
Samaria and confer the gift of the Holy
Ghost by the laying on of hands—Simon
seeks to buy this gift and is rebuked by
Peter—Philip preaches about Christ and
baptizes an Ethiopian eunuch.
And Saul was consenting unto his
death. And at that time there was
a great a persecution against the b church which was at Jerusalem;
and they were all scattered abroad

throughout the regions of Judæa
and Samaria, except the apostles.
2 And devout men carried Stephen
to his burial, and made great a lamentation over him.
3 As for Saul, he made a havoc of
the church, entering into every
house, and haling men and women
committed them to b prison.
4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
preaching the word.
5 Then Philip went down to the
city of a Samaria, and preached
Christ unto them.
6 And the people with one accord
gave heed unto those things which
Philip a spake, hearing and seeing
the miracles which he did.
7 For a unclean spirits, crying with
loud voice, came out of many that
were possessed with them: and many b taken with palsies, and that were
lame, were c healed.
8 And there was great joy in that
city.
9 But there was a certain man,
called Simon, which beforetime in
the same city used a sorcery, and b bewitched the people of Samaria,
giving out that himself was some
c great one:
10 To whom they all gave heed,
from the least to the greatest, say- ing, This man is the great power
of God.
11 And to him they had regard,
because that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries.
12 But when they believed Philip a preaching the things concerning
the kingdom of God, and the b name
of Jesus Christ, they were c baptized,
both men and women.
13 Then Simon himself believed
also: and when he was baptized, he
continued with Philip, and a wondered, beholding the miracles and
signs which were done.
14 Now when the apostles which
were at Jerusalem heard that Sa- maria had received the a word of
God, they sent unto them Peter and
John:
15 Who, when they were come
down, prayed for them, that they
might receive the Holy Ghost:
16 (For as yet he was fallen upon
none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
17 Then a laid they their hands on
them, and they received the b Holy
Ghost.
18 And when Simon saw that
through a laying on of the apostles’
hands the Holy Ghost was given, he
offered them money,
19 Saying, Give me also this a power,
that on whomsoever I lay hands, he
may receive the Holy Ghost.
20 But Peter said unto him, Thy
money perish with thee, because
thou hast thought that the a gift of
God may be b purchased with money.
21 Thou hast neither part nor lot
in this matter: for thy heart is not
a right in the sight of God.
22 Repent therefore of this thy a wickedness, and pray God, if per- haps the b thought of thine c heart
may be forgiven thee.
23 For I perceive that thou art in
the a gall of bitterness, and in the b bond of iniquity.

24 Then answered Simon, and
said, Pray ye to the Lord for me,
that none of these things which ye
have spoken come upon me.
25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and
preached the gospel in many vil- lages of the Samaritans.
26 And the a angel of the Lord spake
unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go
toward the south unto the way that
goeth down from Jerusalem unto
Gaza, which is desert.
27 And he arose and went: and,
behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eu- nuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who
had the charge of all her treasure,
and had come to Jerusalem for to
a worship,
28 Was returning, and sitting in
his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
29 Then the a Spirit said unto Phi- lip, Go near, and join thyself to this
chariot.
30 And Philip ran thither to him,
and heard him read the prophet Es- aias, and said, Understandest thou
what thou readest?
31 And he said, How can I, except
some man should guide me? And he
desired Philip that he would come
up and sit with him.
32 The place of the scripture which
he read was this, He was led as a
sheep to the slaughter; and like a
a lamb dumb before his shearer, so
opened he not his mouth:
33 In his humiliation his judgment
was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is
taken from the earth.
34 And the eunuch answered Phi- lip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
speaketh the prophet this? of him- self, or of some other man?
35 Then Philip opened his mouth,
and began at the same scripture, and
preached unto him a Jesus.
36 And as they went on their way,
they came unto a certain water: and
the eunuch said, See, here is water;
what doth hinder me to be baptized?
37 And Philip said, If thou a believest with all thine heart, thou
mayest. And he answered and said,
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son
of God.
38 And he commanded the chariot
to stand still: and they went down
both into the water, both Philip and
the eunuch; and he a baptized him.
39 And when they were come up
out of the water, the a Spirit of the
Lord caught away Philip, that the
eunuch saw him no more: and he
went on his way rejoicing.
40 But Philip was found at Azotus:
and passing through he preached
in all the cities, till he came to
a Cæsarea.

Jesus appears to Saul—Saul is a chosen vessel—Ananias restores Saul’s
sight—Saul is baptized and begins his
ministry—Peter heals Æneas and raises
Dorcas from death.
And Saul, yet breathing out a threat- enings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord, went unto the
high priest,
2 And desired of him a letters to
Damascus to the synagogues, that if
he found any of this way, whether
they were men or women, he might
bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
3 And as he journeyed, he came
near Damascus: and suddenly there
shined round about him a a light
from heaven:
4 And he a fell to the earth, and
heard a voice saying unto him, b Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?

5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord?
And the Lord said, I am a Jesus whom
thou persecutest: it is hard for thee
to b kick against the pricks.
6 And he trembling and astonished
said, Lord, a what wilt thou have me
to do? And the Lord said unto him,
Arise, and go into the city, and it
shall be told thee what thou must do.
7 a And the men which journeyed
with him stood speechless, hearing
a b voice, but seeing c no man.
8 And Saul arose from the earth;
and when his eyes were opened,
he saw no man: but they led him
by the hand, and brought him into
Damascus.
9 And he was three days without
sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
10 ¶ And there was a certain dis- ciple at Damascus, named a Ananias;
and to him said the Lord in a b vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold,
I am here, Lord.
11 And the Lord said unto him,
Arise, and go into the street which
is called Straight, and inquire in the
house of Judas for one called Saul,
of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
12 And hath seen in a vision a man
named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might
receive his sight.
13 Then Ananias answered, Lord,
I have heard by many of this man,
how much a evil he hath done to thy
saints at Jerusalem:
14 And here he hath authority
from the chief priests to bind all
that call on thy name.
15 But the Lord said unto him, Go
thy way: for he is a a chosen vessel
unto me, to b bear my c name before
the d Gentiles, and e kings, and the
children of Israel:
16 For I will shew him how great
things he must a suffer for my name’s
sake.
17 And Ananias went his way, and
entered into the house; and putting
his a hands on him said, Brother Saul,
the Lord, even Jesus, that b appeared
unto thee in the way as thou camest,
hath c sent me, that thou mightest
receive thy sight, and be filled with
the d Holy Ghost.
18 And immediately there fell from
his eyes as it had been scales: and
he received a sight forthwith, and
arose, and was b baptized.
19 And when he had received meat,
he was strengthened. Then was Saul
certain days with the disciples which
were at Damascus.
20 And straightway he preached
Christ in the synagogues, that he
is the Son of God.
21 But all that heard him were
amazed, and said; Is not this he that
a destroyed them which called on
this name in Jerusalem, and came
hither for that intent, that he might
bring them b bound unto the chief
priests?
22 But Saul increased the more in
strength, and confounded the Jews
which dwelt at Damascus, proving
that this is very Christ.
23 ¶ And after that many days
were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to a kill him:

known of Saul. And they watched
the gates day and night to kill him.
25 Then the disciples took him by
night, and let him down by the wall
in a a basket.
26 And when Saul was come to a Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were
all afraid of him, and believed not
that he was a disciple.
27 But Barnabas took him, and
brought him to the apostles, and
declared unto them how he had
a seen the Lord in the way, and that
he had spoken to him, and how he
had preached boldly at Damascus
in the name of Jesus.
28 And he was with them coming
in and going out at Jerusalem.
29 And he spake boldly in the name
of the Lord Jesus, and a disputed
against the Grecians: but they went
about to slay him.
30 Which when the brethren knew,
they brought him down to Cæsarea,
and sent him forth to Tarsus.
31 Then had the churches rest
throughout all Judæa and Galilee
and Samaria, and were a edified; and
walking in the fear of the Lord, and
in the b comfort of the Holy Ghost,
were multiplied.
32 ¶ And it came to pass, as Peter
passed throughout all quarters, he
came down also to the a saints which
dwelt at Lydda.
33 And there he found a certain
man named Æneas, which had kept
his bed eight years, and was a sick
of the palsy.
34 And Peter said unto him, Æneas,
Jesus Christ maketh thee whole:
arise, and make thy bed. And he
arose immediately.
35 And all that dwelt at Lydda
and Saron saw him, and turned to
the Lord.
36 ¶ Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which
by interpretation is called Dorcas:
this a woman was full of good works
and almsdeeds which she did.
37 And it came to pass in those
days, that she was sick, and died:
whom when they had washed, they
laid her in an upper chamber.
38 And forasmuch as Lydda was
nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had
heard that Peter was there, they
sent unto him two men, desiring
him that he would not delay to come
to them.
39 Then Peter arose and went
with them. When he was come,
they brought him into the upper
chamber: and all the widows stood
by him weeping, and shewing the
coats and garments which Dorcas
made, while she was with them.
40 But Peter put them all forth,
and kneeled down, and prayed;
and turning him to the body said,
Tabitha, a arise. And she opened
her eyes: and when she saw Peter,
she sat up.
41 And he gave her his hand, and
lifted her up, and when he had
called the a saints and widows, presented her b alive.
42 And it was known throughout
all Joppa; and many believed in
the Lord.
43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one
Simon a tanner.
Chapter 10

in a vision, is commanded to take the
gospel to the Gentiles—The gospel is

called Cornelius, a centurion of the
band called the Italian band,

gave much a alms to the people, and
prayed to God alway.
3 He saw in a a vision b evidently
about the ninth hour of the day an
c angel of God coming in to him, and
saying unto him, Cornelius.
4 And when he looked on him,
he was afraid, and said, What is it,
Lord? And he said unto him, Thy
prayers and thine alms are come up
for a memorial before God.
5 And now send men to Joppa, and
call for one Simon, whose surname
is Peter:
6 He lodgeth with one Simon a
tanner, whose house is by the sea
side: he shall tell thee what thou
oughtest to do.
7 And when the angel which spake
unto Cornelius was departed, he
called two of his household servants,
and a devout soldier of them that
waited on him continually;
8 And when he had declared all
these things unto them, he sent them
to Joppa.
9 ¶ On the morrow, as they went
on their journey, and drew nigh
unto the city, Peter went up upon
the a housetop to pray about the
sixth hour:
10 And he became very hungry, and
would have eaten: but while they
made ready, he fell into a a trance,
11 And saw a heaven opened, and a
certain vessel descending unto him,
as it had been a great sheet b knit
at the four corners, and let down
to the earth:
12 Wherein were all manner of
fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
wild beasts, and creeping things,
and fowls of the air.
13 And there came a voice to him,
Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for
I have never eaten any thing that is
common or a unclean.
15 And the voice spake unto him
again the second time, What God
hath a cleansed, that call not thou b common.
16 This was done thrice: and the
vessel was received up again into
heaven.
17 Now while Peter doubted in
himself what this vision which he
had seen should mean, behold, the
men which were sent from Corne- lius had made inquiry for Simon’s
house, and stood before the gate,
18 And called, and asked whether
Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
were lodged there.
19 ¶ While Peter thought on the
vision, the a Spirit said unto him,
Behold, three men seek thee.
20 Arise therefore, and get thee
down, and a go with them, doubting
nothing: for I have sent them.
21 Then Peter went down to the
men which were sent unto him
from Cornelius; and said, Behold,
I am he whom ye seek: what is the
cause wherefore ye are come?
22 And they said, Cornelius the
centurion, a just man, and one that
feareth God, and of good report
among all the nation of the Jews,
was a warned from God by an holy
angel to send for thee into his house,
and to hear words of thee.
23 Then called he them in, and
lodged them. And on the morrow
Peter went away with them, and
certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
24 And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius
waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
25 And as Peter was coming in,
Cornelius met him, and fell down
at his feet, and worshipped him.
26 But Peter took him up, saying,
Stand up; I myself also am a a man.

27 And as he talked with him, he
went in, and found many that were
come together.

nation; but God hath shewed me that
I should not call any man a common
or b unclean.
29 Therefore came I unto you with- out gainsaying, as soon as I was sent
for: I ask therefore for what intent
ye have sent for me?
30 And Cornelius said, Four days
ago I was a fasting until this hour;
and at the ninth hour I prayed in
my house, and, behold, a b man stood
before me in bright clothing,
31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer
is heard, and thine alms are had
in remembrance in the sight of
God.
32 Send therefore to Joppa, and
call hither Simon, whose surname
is Peter; he is lodged in the house
of one Simon a tanner by the sea
side: who, when he cometh, shall
speak unto thee.
33 Immediately therefore I sent to
thee; and thou hast well done that
thou art come. Now therefore are
we all here present before God, to
hear all things that are commanded
thee of God.
34 ¶ Then Peter opened his mouth,
and said, Of a truth I perceive that
God is no a respecter of persons:
35 But in every a nation he that b feareth him, and c worketh d righ- teousness, is e accepted with him.
36 The a word which God sent unto
the children of Israel, preaching
peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord
of all:)
37 That word, I say, ye know, which
was published throughout all Judæa,
and began from Galilee, after the
baptism which John preached;
38 How God a anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the b Holy Ghost and
with power: who went about doing
good, and healing all that were c oppressed of the devil; for d God was
with him.
39 And we are a witnesses of all
things which he did both in the
land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem;
whom they slew and hanged on
a tree:
40 Him God a raised up the third
day, and b shewed him openly;
41 a Not to all the people, but unto
witnesses chosen before of God,
even to us, who did eat and drink
with him after he rose from the
dead.
42 And he commanded us to a preach unto the people, and to
testify that it is he which was b ordained of God to be the c Judge of
quick and dead.
43 To him give all the prophets a witness, that through his b name
whosoever c believeth in him shall
receive d remission of sins.
44 ¶ While Peter yet spake these
words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
them which heard the word.
45 And they of the circumcision
which believed were astonished, as
many as came with Peter, because

that on the a Gentiles also was poured
out the b gift of the Holy Ghost.
46 For they heard them speak with a tongues, and magnify God. Then
answered Peter,
47 Can any man forbid water, that
these should not be baptized, which
have received the a Holy Ghost as
well as we?
48 And he commanded them to be a baptized in the name of the Lord.
Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
Chapter 11
God grants the gift of repentance to the
Gentiles—The disciples are first called
Christians at Antioch—The Church is
guided by revelation.
And the apostles and brethren that
were in Judæa heard that the a Gentiles had also received the b word
of God.
2 And when Peter was come up
to Jerusalem, they that were of the
a circumcision b contended with him,
3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men
uncircumcised, and didst eat with
them.
4 But Peter rehearsed the matter
from the beginning, and expounded
it by order unto them, saying,
5 I was in the city of Joppa pray- ing: and in a a trance I saw a vision,
A certain vessel descend, as it had
been a great sheet, let down from
heaven by four corners; and it came
even to me:
6 Upon the which when I had fas- tened mine eyes, I considered, and
saw fourfooted beasts of the earth,
and wild beasts, and creeping things,
and fowls of the air.
7 And I heard a voice saying unto
me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any
time entered into my mouth.
9 But the voice answered me
again from heaven, What God hath
a cleansed, that call not thou b common.
10 And this was done three times:
and all were drawn up again into
heaven.
11 And, behold, immediately there
were three men already come unto
the house where I was, sent from
Cæsarea unto me.
12 And the Spirit bade me go with
them, nothing doubting. Moreover
these six brethren accompanied
me, and we entered into the man’s
house:
13 And he shewed us how he had
seen an angel in his house, which
stood and said unto him, Send men
to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose
surname is Peter;
14 Who shall tell thee words,
whereby thou and all thy house
shall be saved.
15 And as I began to speak, the
Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
at the beginning.
16 Then remembered I the word
of the Lord, how that he said, John
indeed baptized with water; but
ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost.
17 Forasmuch then as God gave
them the like a gift as he did unto
us, who believed on the Lord Jesus
Christ; what was I, that I could with- stand God?
18 When they heard these things,
they held their peace, and glorified
God, saying, Then hath God also to
the a Gentiles granted b repentance
unto life.

as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and
Antioch, preaching the word to none
but unto the Jews only.
20 And some of them were men of
Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
they were come to Antioch, spake
unto the Grecians, preaching the
Lord Jesus.
21 And the hand of the Lord was
with them: and a great number be- lieved, and turned unto the Lord.
22 ¶ Then tidings of these things
came unto the ears of the church
which was in Jerusalem: and they
sent forth a Barnabas, that he should
go as far as Antioch.
23 Who, when he came, and had
seen the grace of God, was glad,
and exhorted them all, that with
purpose of heart they would cleave
unto the Lord.
24 For he was a good man, and
full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:
and much people was added unto
the Lord.
25 Then departed Barnabas to Tar- sus, for to seek Saul:
26 And when he had found him,
he brought him unto Antioch. And
it came to pass, that a whole year
they a assembled themselves with
the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called
b Christians first in c Antioch.
27 ¶ And in these days came a prophets from Jerusalem unto
Antioch.
28 And there stood up one of them
named Agabus, and signified by the
a Spirit that there should be great
b dearth throughout all the world:
which came to pass in the days of
Claudius Cæsar.
29 Then the disciples, every man
according to his ability, determined
to send a relief unto the brethren
which dwelt in Judæa:
30 Which also they did, and sent
it to the a elders by the hands of
Barnabas and Saul.
Chapter 12
The martyrdom of James is described—
An angel frees Peter from prison—The
Lord slays Herod by disease—The
Church grows.
Now about that time Herod the
king stretched forth his hands to
vex certain of the church.
2 And he a killed b James the brother
of John with the sword.
3 And because he saw it pleased
the Jews, he proceeded further to
take Peter also. (Then were the days
of a unleavened bread.)
4 And when he had apprehended
him, he put him in a prison, and de- livered him to four b quaternions
of soldiers to keep him; intending
after c Easter to bring him forth to
the people.
5 Peter therefore was kept in
prison: but prayer was made with- out ceasing of the church unto God
for him.
6 And when Herod would have
brought him forth, the same night
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and
the keepers before the door kept
the prison.
7 And, behold, the a angel of the
Lord came upon him, and a light
shined in the prison: and he smote
Peter on the side, and raised him
up, saying, Arise up quickly. And
his chains fell off from his hands.
8 And the angel said unto him,
Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith
unto him, Cast thy garment about
thee, and follow me.
9 And he went out, and followed

him; and a wist not that it was true
which was done by the angel; but
thought he saw a vision.
10 When they were past the first
and the second ward, they came
unto the iron gate that leadeth unto
the city; which opened to them of
his own accord: and they went out,
and passed on through one street;
and forthwith the angel departed
from him.
11 And when Peter was come to
himself, he said, Now I know of a
surety, that the Lord hath sent his
angel, and hath delivered me out of
the hand of Herod, and from all the
expectation of the people of the Jews.
12 And when he had considered the
thing, he came to the house of Mary
the mother of John, whose surname
was Mark; where many were gath- ered together praying.
13 And as Peter knocked at the
door of the gate, a damsel came to
hearken, named Rhoda.
14 And when she knew Peter’s
voice, she opened not the gate for
gladness, but ran in, and told how
Peter stood before the gate.
15 And they said unto her, Thou
art mad. But she constantly affirmed
that it was even so. Then said they,
It is his angel.
16 But Peter continued knocking:
and when they had opened the door,
and saw him, they were astonished.
17 But he, a beckoning unto them
with the hand to hold their peace,
declared unto them how the Lord
had brought him out of the prison.
And he said, Go shew these things
unto James, and to the brethren.
And he departed, and went into
another place.
18 Now as soon as it was day, there
was no small stir among the soldiers,
what was become of Peter.
19 And when Herod had sought for
him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded
that they should be put to a death.
And he went down from Judæa to
Cæsarea, and there abode.
20 ¶ And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord
to him, and, having made Blastus
the king’s chamberlain their friend,
desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s
country.
21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon
his throne, and made an oration
unto them.
22 And the people gave a shout,
saying, It is the voice of a god, and
not of a man.
23 And immediately the a angel of
the Lord smote him, because he gave
not God the glory: and he was eaten
of worms, and gave up the ghost.
24 ¶ But the word of God grew
and multiplied.
25 And Barnabas and Saul returned
from Jerusalem, when they had
fulfilled their a ministry, and took
with them John, whose surname
was Mark.
Chapter 13
Saul and Barnabas are called to missionary service—Saul, now called Paul,
curses a sorcerer—Christ is a descendant of David—Paul offers the gospel
to Israel, then to the Gentiles.
Now there were in the church that
was at Antioch certain a prophets and
teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon
that was called Niger, and Lucius
of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had
been brought up with Herod the
tetrarch, and Saul.
2 As they ministered to the Lord,
and a fasted, the b Holy Ghost said, c Separate me Barnabas and Saul for
the work whereunto I have d called
them.

prayed, and a laid their b hands on
them, they sent them away.
4 ¶ So they, being sent forth by the
Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleu- cia; and from thence they sailed
to Cyprus.
5 And when they were at Salamis,
they preached the word of God in
the synagogues of the Jews: and
they had also John to their minister.
6 And when they had gone through
the isle unto Paphos, they found a
certain a sorcerer, a false prophet,
a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:
7 Which was with the deputy of
the country, Sergius Paulus, a a pru- dent man; who called for Barnabas
and Saul, and desired to hear the
word of God.
8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so
is his name by interpretation) with- stood them, seeking to turn away
the deputy from the faith.
9 Then Saul, (who also is called
Paul,) filled with the a Holy Ghost,
set his eyes on him,
10 And said, O full of all subtilty
and all mischief, thou a child of the
devil, thou b enemy of all c righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert
the right ways of the Lord?
11 And now, behold, the hand of
the Lord is upon thee, and thou a shalt be b blind, not seeing the sun
for a season. And immediately there
fell on him a mist and a darkness;
and he went about seeking some to
lead him by the hand.
12 Then the deputy, when he saw
what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came
to Perga in Pamphylia: and a John
departing from them returned to
Jerusalem.
14 ¶ But when they departed
from Perga, they came to Antioch
in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat
down.
15 And after the reading of the
law and the prophets the rulers
of the synagogue sent unto them,
saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye
have any word of exhortation for
the people, say on.
16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
Israel, and ye that a fear God, give
audience.
17 The God of this people of Israel
chose our fathers, and exalted the
people when they dwelt as a strangers
in the land of Egypt, and with an
high arm brought he them out of it.
18 And about the time of forty
years suffered he their manners in
the wilderness.
19 And when he had a destroyed
seven nations in the b land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them
by lot.
20 And after that he gave unto them
judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel
the prophet.
21 And afterward they desired a
king: and God gave unto them Saul
the son of Cis, a man of the tribe
of Benjamin, by the space of forty
years.
22 And when he had removed him,
he raised up unto them David to be
their king; to whom also he gave
testimony, and said, I have found
David the son of Jesse, a man after
mine own a heart, which shall fulfil
all my will.
23 Of this man’s a seed hath God
according to his b promise raised
unto Israel a c Saviour, Jesus:

24 When John had first preached
before his coming the baptism of re- pentance to all the people of Israel.
25 And as John fulfilled his course,
he said, Whom think ye that I am? I
am not he. But, behold, there cometh
one after me, whose shoes of his feet
I am not worthy to loose.
26 Men and brethren, children of
the stock of a Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you
is the word of this salvation sent.
27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
knew him not, nor yet the voices of
the prophets which are read every
sabbath day, they have fulfilled them
in condemning him.
28 And though they found no cause
of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be a slain.
29 And when they had fulfilled all
that was written of him, they took
him down from the tree, and laid
him in a sepulchre.
30 But God raised him from the
dead:
31 And he was a seen many days
of them which came up with him
from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are
his b witnesses unto the people.
32 And we declare unto you glad
tidings, how that the promise which
was made unto the a fathers,
33 God hath fulfilled the same
unto us their children, in that he
hath raised up Jesus again; as it is
also written in the second psalm,
Thou art my a Son, this day have I
begotten thee.
34 And as concerning that he raised
him up from the dead, now no more
to return to corruption, he said on
this wise, I will give you the a sure
mercies of David.
35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer
thine Holy One to see corruption.
36 For David, after he had served
his own generation by the will of
God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto
his fathers, and saw corruption:
37 But he, whom God a raised again,
saw no b corruption.
38 ¶ Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
this man is preached unto you the
a forgiveness of sins:
39 And by him all that believe
are a justified from all things, from
which ye could not be b justified by
the c law of Moses.
40 Beware therefore, lest that come
upon you, which is spoken of in the
prophets;
41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in
your days, a a work which ye shall
in no wise believe, though a man
declare it unto you.
42 And when the Jews were gone
out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
besought that these words might be
preached to them the next a sabbath.
43 Now when the congregation
was broken up, many of the Jews
and religious a proselytes followed
Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to
them, persuaded them to continue
in the grace of God.
44 ¶ And the next sabbath day
came almost the whole city together
to hear the word of God.
45 But when the Jews saw the
multitudes, they were filled with
a envy, and spake b against those
things which were spoken by Paul,
contradicting and c blaspheming.
46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed
bold, and said, It was necessary that

the word of God should first have
been spoken to you: but seeing ye
put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
lo, we turn to the a Gentiles.
47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to
be a a light of the Gentiles, that thou
shouldest be for b salvation unto the
ends of the earth.
48 And when the Gentiles heard
this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of the Lord: a and as many
as were ordained to eternal life believed.
49 And the word of the Lord was a published throughout all the region.
50 But the Jews a stirred up the
devout and honourable b women,
and the chief men of the city, and
raised c persecution against Paul
and Barnabas, and expelled them
out of their coasts.
51 But they shook off the a dust of
their feet against them, and came
unto Iconium.
52 And the disciples were filled
with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
Chapter 14
Persecution attends the spread of the
gospel—Paul heals a crippled man; Paul
and Barnabas are hailed as gods—Paul
is stoned and revived; he preaches—
Elders are ordained.
And it came to pass in Iconium,
that they went both together into
the synagogue of the Jews, and so
spake, that a great multitude both
of the Jews and also of the Greeks
believed.
2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred
up the Gentiles, and made their
minds evil affected against the
brethren.
3 Long time therefore abode they
speaking boldly in the Lord, which
gave a testimony unto the word of
his b grace, and granted signs and
wonders to be done by their hands.
4 But the multitude of the city was
divided: and part held with the Jews,
and part with the apostles.
5 And when there was an assault
made both of the Gentiles, and also
of the a Jews with their rulers, to use
them despitefully, and to stone them,
6 They were ware of it, and fled
unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of
Lycaonia, and unto the region that
lieth round about:
7 And there they preached the
gospel.
8 ¶ And there sat a certain man at
Lystra, impotent in his feet, being
a a cripple from his mother’s womb,
who never had walked:
9 The same heard Paul speak: who
steadfastly beholding him, and
perceiving that he had a faith to be b healed,
10 Said with a loud voice, Stand
upright on thy feet. And he leaped
and walked.
11 And when the people saw what
Paul had done, they lifted up their
voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The a gods are come down
to us in the likeness of men.
12 And they called Barnabas, a Ju- piter; and Paul, b Mercurius, because
he was the chief speaker.
13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which
was before their city, brought oxen
and garlands unto the gates, and
would have done sacrifice with the
people.
14 Which when the a apostles,
Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they
rent their clothes, and ran in among
the people, crying out,

15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye
these things? We also are a men of
like b passions with you, and preach
unto you that ye should turn from
these c vanities unto the living God,
which d made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and all things that are
therein:
16 Who in times past suffered all
nations to a walk in their own b ways.
17 Nevertheless he left not himself
without a witness, in that he did good,
and gave us b rain from heaven, and
fruitful seasons, filling our hearts
with c food and gladness.
18 And with these sayings scarce
restrained they the people, that they
had not done sacrifice unto them.
19 ¶ And there came thither certain
Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
persuaded the people, and, having
a stoned Paul, drew him out of the
city, supposing he had been dead.
20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood
round about him, he rose up, and
came into the city: and the next
day he departed with Barnabas
to Derbe.
21 And when they had preached
the gospel to that city, and had
taught many, they returned again to
Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
22 Confirming the souls of the dis- ciples, and exhorting them to con- tinue in the faith, and that we must
through much a tribulation enter
into the kingdom of God.
23 And when they had a ordained
them b elders in every church, and
had prayed with c fasting, they com- mended them to the Lord, on whom
they believed.
24 And after they had passed
throughout Pisidia, they came to
Pamphylia.
25 And when they had preached
the word in Perga, they went down
into Attalia:
26 And thence sailed to a Antioch,
from whence they had been recom- mended to the grace of God for the
work which they fulfilled.
27 And when they were come, and
had gathered the church together,
they rehearsed all that God had done
with them, and how he had opened
the a door of faith unto the Gentiles.
28 And there they abode long time
with the disciples.
Chapter 15
Great dissension arises at Antioch concerning circumcision—The Apostles
at Jerusalem decide the issue—Paul
chooses Silas as his companion.
And certain men which came down
from Judæa taught the brethren,
and said, Except ye be a circumcised
after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
a disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and
certain other of them, should go up
to Jerusalem unto the b apostles and
elders about this question.
3 And being brought on their way
by the church, they passed through
Phenice and Samaria, declaring the
a conversion of the Gentiles: and
they caused great joy unto all the
brethren.
4 And when they were come to
Jerusalem, they were received of
the church, and of the apostles and
elders, and they declared all things
that God had done with them.

sect of the Pharisees which believed,
saying, That it was needful to cir- cumcise them, and to command them
to keep the a law of Moses.
6 ¶ And the a apostles and b elders
came together for to consider of
this matter.
7 And when there had been much a disputing, b Peter rose up, and said
unto them, Men and brethren, ye
know how that a good while ago
God made choice among us, that
the c Gentiles by my mouth should
hear the word of the d gospel, and
believe.
8 And God, which a knoweth the
hearts, bare them witness, giving
them the Holy Ghost, even as he
did unto us;
9 And put no a difference between
us and them, b purifying their hearts
by faith.
10 Now therefore why a tempt ye
God, to put a yoke upon the neck
of the disciples, which neither our
fathers nor we were able to bear?
11 But we believe that through the a grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we
shall be saved, even as they.
12 ¶ Then all the multitude kept
silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought
among the Gentiles by them.
13 ¶ And after they had held their
peace, James answered, saying, Men
and brethren, hearken unto me:
14 Simeon hath declared how God
at the first did visit the a Gentiles,
to take out of them a people for
his b name.
15 And to this agree the words of
the prophets; as it is written,
16 After this I will return, and
will build again the a tabernacle of
David, which is fallen down; and I
will build again the ruins thereof,
and I will set it up:
17 That the a residue of men might
seek after the Lord, and all the
Gentiles, upon whom my name is
called, saith the Lord, who doeth
all these things.
18 a Known unto God are all his
works from the beginning of the
world.
19 Wherefore my sentence is, that
we trouble not them, which from
among the Gentiles are turned to
God:
20 But that we write unto them,
that they a abstain from b pollutions
of idols, and from c fornication, and
from things strangled, and from d blood.
21 For Moses of old time hath in
every city them that preach him,
being a read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
22 Then pleased it the apostles
and elders, with the whole church,
to send chosen men of their own
company to Antioch with Paul and
Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed
Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among
the brethren:
23 And they a wrote b letters by them
after this manner; The apostles and
elders and brethren send greeting
unto the brethren which are of the
Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and
Cilicia:
24 Forasmuch as we have heard,
that certain which went out from
us have troubled you with words,
subverting your souls, saying, Ye
must be a circumcised, and keep the
law: to whom we gave no such commandment:

assembled with a one accord, to send
chosen men unto you with our be- loved Barnabas and Paul,
26 Men that have a hazarded their
lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
27 We have sent therefore Judas
and Silas, who shall also tell you the
same things by mouth.
28 For it seemed good to the Holy
Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
no greater burden than these necessary things;
29 That ye abstain from meats offered to a idols, and from blood, and
from things strangled, and from
fornication: from which if ye keep
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare
ye well.
30 So when they were dismissed,
they came to Antioch: and when
they had gathered the multitude
together, they delivered the epistle:
31 Which when they had read, they
rejoiced for the a consolation.
32 And Judas and Silas, being
prophets also themselves, exhorted
the brethren with many words, and
confirmed them.
33 And after they had tarried there
a space, they were let go in peace
from the brethren unto the apostles.
34 Notwithstanding it pleased a Silas to abide there still.
35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
preaching the word of the Lord,
with many others also.
36 ¶ And some days after Paul said
unto Barnabas, Let us go again and
a visit our b brethren in every city
where we have preached the word
of the Lord, and see how they do.
37 And Barnabas determined to
take with them a John, whose surname was b Mark.
38 But Paul thought not good to
take him with them, who departed
from them from Pamphylia, and
went not with them to the work.
39 And the a contention was so
sharp between them, that they de- parted asunder one from the other:
and so Barnabas took Mark, and
sailed unto Cyprus;
40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
brethren unto the grace of God.
41 And he went through Syria and
Cilicia, a confirming the churches.
Chapter 16
Paul is directed in a vision to preach
in Macedonia—He casts an evil spirit
out of a woman—He and Silas are imprisoned, and they convert the jailor—
They admonish all to believe on the
Lord Jesus and be saved.
Then came he to Derbe and Lystra:
and, behold, a certain disciple was
there, named a Timotheus, the son
of a certain woman, which was a
b Jewess, and believed; but his father
was a Greek:
2 Which was well reported of by
the brethren that were at Lystra
and Iconium.
3 Him would Paul have to go forth
with him; and took and a circumcised
him because of the Jews which were
in those quarters: for they knew all
that his father was a Greek.
4 And as they went through the cit- ies, they delivered them the a decrees
for to keep, that were ordained of
the apostles and elders which were
at Jerusalem.
5 And so were the churches a estab- lished in the faith, and increased in
number daily.

a Holy Ghost to preach the word in
Asia,
7 After they were come to Mysia,
they assayed to go into Bithynia:
but the Spirit suffered them not.
8 And they passing by Mysia came
down to Troas.
9 And a a vision appeared to Paul
in the night; There stood a man of
Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia,
and help us.
10 And after he had seen the vision,
immediately we endeavoured to go
into Macedonia, assuredly gathering
that the Lord had called us for to
preach the gospel unto them.
11 Therefore loosing from Troas,
we came with a straight course to
Samothracia, and the next day to
Neapolis;
12 And from thence to Philippi,
which is the chief city of that part
of Macedonia, and a colony: and we
were in that city abiding certain days.
13 And on the sabbath we went
out of the city by a river side, where
prayer was wont to be made; and
we sat down, and spake unto the
women which resorted thither.
14 ¶ And a certain woman named a Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
of Thyatira, which worshipped God,
heard us: whose b heart the Lord
opened, that she attended unto the
things which were spoken of Paul.
15 And when she was baptized,
and her household, she besought
us, saying, If ye have judged me to
be faithful to the Lord, come into
my house, and a abide there. And she
constrained us.
16 ¶ And it came to pass, as we
went to prayer, a certain damsel
possessed with a spirit of divination
met us, which brought her masters
much gain by a soothsaying:
17 The same followed Paul and us,
and cried, saying, a These men are
the servants of the most high God,
which shew unto us the way of
salvation.
18 And this did she many days.
But Paul, being grieved, turned
and said to the a spirit, I command
thee in the name of Jesus Christ to
come out of her. And he came out
the same hour.
19 ¶ And when her masters saw
that the hope of their gains was
gone, they caught Paul and Silas,
and drew them into the marketplace
unto the rulers,
20 And brought them to the mag- istrates, saying, These men, being
Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
21 And teach customs, which are
not lawful for us to receive, neither
to observe, being Romans.
22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and
commanded to a beat them.
23 And when they had laid many a stripes upon them, they cast them
into prison, charging the jailor to
keep them safely:
24 Who, having received such a
charge, thrust them into the inner
prison, and made their feet fast in
the stocks.
25 ¶ And at a midnight Paul and
Silas prayed, and b sang praises unto
God: and the prisoners heard them.
26 And suddenly there was a great
earthquake, so that the foundations
of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the a doors were opened,
and every one’s bands were loosed.
27 And the keeper of the prison
awaking out of his sleep, and seeing
the prison doors open, he drew out
his sword, and would have killed
himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
28 But Paul cried with a loud voice,

saying, Do thyself no harm: for we

29 Then he called for a light, and
sprang in, and came trembling, and
fell down before Paul and Silas,
30 And brought them out, and said,
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
31 And they said, a Believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved, and thy house.
32 And they spake unto him the
word of the Lord, and to all that
were in his house.
33 And he took them the same
hour of the night, and washed their
stripes; and was baptized, he and
all his, straightway.
34 And when he had brought them
into his house, he set meat before
them, and rejoiced, believing in God
with all his house.
35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,
Let those men go.
36 And the keeper of the prison
told this saying to Paul, The mag- istrates have sent to let you go:
now therefore depart, and go in
peace.
37 But Paul said unto them, They
have beaten us openly uncondemned, being a Romans, and have
cast us into prison; and now do they
thrust us out b privily ? nay verily;
but let them come themselves and
fetch us out.
38 And the serjeants told these
words unto the magistrates: and
they feared, when they heard that
they were Romans.
39 And they came and besought
them, and brought them out, and
desired them to depart out of the
city.
40 And they went out of the prison,
and entered into the house of a Lydia: and when they had seen the
brethren, they comforted them,
and departed.
Chapter 17
Paul and Silas preach and are persecuted in Thessalonica and in Berea—
Paul, in Athens, preaches from Mars’
Hill about the unknown god—He says,
We are the offspring of God.
Now when they had passed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
came to a Thessalonica, where was
a synagogue of the Jews:
2 And Paul, as his manner was,
went in unto them, and three sabbath days a reasoned with them out
of the b scriptures,
3 Opening and alleging, that Christ
must needs have suffered, and risen
again from the dead; and that this
Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is
Christ.
4 And some of them believed, and
consorted with Paul and Silas; and
of the devout a Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief b women
not a few.
5 ¶ But the a Jews which believed
not, moved with envy, took unto
them certain b lewd fellows of
the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an
c uproar, and d assaulted the house
of Jason, and sought to bring them
out to the people.
6 And when they found them
not, they drew Jason and certain
brethren unto the rulers of the
city, crying, These that have turned
the world upside down are come
hither also;
7 Whom Jason hath received: and
these all do contrary to the decrees
of Cæsar, saying that there is another
king, one Jesus.
8 And they troubled the people
and the rulers of the city, when
they heard these things.
9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they
let them go.

10 ¶ And the brethren immediately
sent away Paul and Silas by night
unto Berea: who coming thither went
into the synagogue of the Jews.
11 These were more noble than
those in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word with all readiness
of mind, and a searched the scriptures daily, whether those things
were so.
12 Therefore many of them be- lieved; also of honourable women
which were Greeks, and of men,
not a few.
13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
of God was preached of Paul at
Berea, they came thither also, and
stirred up the people.
14 And then immediately the
brethren sent away Paul to go as it
were to the sea: but Silas and a Timotheus abode there still.
15 And they that conducted Paul
brought him unto a Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas
and Timotheus for to come to him
with all speed, they departed.
16 ¶ Now while Paul waited for
them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
in him, when he saw the city a wholly
given to b idolatry.
17 Therefore a disputed he in the b synagogue with the Jews, and with
the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
him.
18 Then certain philosophers of
the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said,
What will this babbler say ? other
some, He seemeth to be a setter
forth of strange gods: because he
preached unto them Jesus, and the
resurrection.
19 And they took him, and brought
him unto a Areopagus, saying, May
we know what this new doctrine,
whereof thou speakest, is?
20 For thou bringest certain
strange things to our ears: we would
know therefore what these things
mean.
21 (For all the Athenians and
strangers which were there a spent
their time in nothing else, but either
to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
22 ¶ Then Paul stood in the midst
of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of
Athens, I perceive that in all things
ye are a too superstitious.
23 For as I passed by, and beheld
your a devotions, I found an altar
with this inscription, To the b Unknown God. Whom therefore ye c ignorantly worship, him d declare
I unto you.
24 God that a made the world and
all things therein, seeing that he is
Lord of heaven and earth, b dwelleth
not in temples made with hands;
25 Neither is a worshipped with
men’s hands, as though he needed
any thing, seeing he giveth to all
life, and b breath, and all things;
26 And hath a made of b one c blood d all e nations of men for to dwell on
all the face of the earth, and hath

Lord, b if haply they might c feel after him, and find him, though he be
not far from every one of us:
28 For in him we a live, and move,
and have our being; as certain also
of your own poets have said, For we
are also his b offspring.
29 Forasmuch then as we are the a offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto
b gold, or silver, or stone, graven by
art and man’s c device.
30 And the times of this a ignorance
God b winked at; but now c commandeth all men every where to
d repent:
31 Because he hath appointed a
day, in the which he will a judge the
world in righteousness by that man
whom he hath b ordained; whereof he
hath given assurance unto all men,
in that he hath c raised him from
the dead.
32 ¶ And when they heard of the a resurrection of the dead, some
b mocked: and others said, We will
hear thee again of this matter.
33 So Paul departed from among
them.
34 Howbeit certain men clave unto
him, and believed: among the which
was Dionysius the a Areopagite, and
a woman named Damaris, and oth- ers with them.
Chapter 18
Being rejected by the Jews, Paul turns
to the Gentiles—He preaches, ministers, and travels—Apollos also preaches
with power.
After these things Paul departed
from Athens, and came to Corinth;
2 And found a certain Jew named a Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come
from Italy, with his wife Priscilla;
(because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from
Rome:) and came unto them.
3 And because he was of the same
craft, he abode with them, and
a wrought: for by their occupation
they were b tentmakers.
4 And he reasoned in the a synagogue every b sabbath, and persuaded
the Jews and the Greeks.
5 And when Silas and a Timotheus were come from Macedonia,
Paul was pressed in the spirit, and
b testified to the Jews that Jesus was c Christ.
6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he a shook
his raiment, and said unto them,
Your b blood be upon your own heads;
I am clean: from henceforth I will
go unto the Gentiles.
7 ¶ And he departed thence, and
entered into a certain man’s house,
named Justus, one that worshipped
God, whose house joined hard to
the synagogue.
8 And a Crispus, the chief ruler of
the synagogue, believed on the Lord
with all his house; and many of the
Corinthians hearing b believed, and
were baptized.

9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in
the night by a a vision, Be not afraid,
but speak, and hold not thy peace:
10 For I am with thee, and no man
shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I
have much a people in this city.
11 And he continued there a year
and six months, teaching the word
of God among them.
12 ¶ And when Gallio was the
deputy of Achaia, the Jews made in- surrection with one accord against
Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth
men to a worship God contrary to
the law.
14 And when Paul was now about to
open his mouth, Gallio said unto the
Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or
a wicked b lewdness, O ye Jews, reason
would that I should bear with you:
15 But if it be a a question of words
and names, and of your law, look ye
to it; for I will be no judge of such
matters.
16 And he drave them from the
judgment seat.
17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the
judgment seat. And Gallio cared
for none of those things.
18 ¶ And Paul after this tarried
there yet a good while, and then
took his leave of the brethren, and
sailed thence into Syria, and with
him Priscilla and Aquila; having
shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he
had a a vow.
19 And he came to Ephesus, and
left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and a reasoned with the Jews.
20 When they desired him to tarry
longer time with them, he consented not;
21 But bade them farewell, saying,
I must by all means keep this feast
that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will
return again unto you, if God will.
And he sailed from Ephesus.
22 And when he had landed at
Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted
the church, he went down to Antioch.
23 And after he had spent some
time there, he departed, and went
over all the country of Galatia and
Phrygia in order, strengthening all
the disciples.
24 ¶ And a certain Jew named a Apollos, born at Alexandria, an
eloquent man, and b mighty in the
scriptures, came to Ephesus.
25 This man was a instructed in
the way of the Lord; and being
b fervent in the spirit, he spake and
taught c diligently the things of the
Lord, knowing only the baptism
of d John.
26 And he began to speak boldly in
the synagogue: whom when Aquila
and Priscilla had heard, they took
him unto them, and expounded unto
him the way of God more perfectly.
27 And when he was disposed
to pass into Achaia, the brethren
a wrote, exhorting the disciples to
receive him: who, when he was
come, helped them much which
had believed through grace:
28 For he mightily convinced the
Jews, and that publickly, a shewing
by the scriptures that b Jesus was
Christ.
Chapter 19
Paul confers the gift of the Holy Ghost
by the laying on of hands—He preaches
and works many miracles—The sons
of Sceva fail to cast out devils by ex- orcism—The worshippers of Diana

passed through the upper a coasts
came to Ephesus: and finding cer- tain disciples,
2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye be- lieved? And they said unto him, We
have not so much as heard whether
there be any Holy Ghost.
3 And he said unto them, Unto
what then were ye baptized? And
they said, Unto a John’s baptism.
4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of a repentance, saying unto the people, that
they should believe on him which
should come after him, that is, on
Christ Jesus.
5 When they heard this, they were a baptized in the name of the Lord
Jesus.
6 And when Paul had laid his hands
upon them, the Holy Ghost came on
them; and they spake with a tongues,
and prophesied.
7 And all the men were about
twelve.
8 And he went into the a synagogue,
and spake boldly for the space of
three months, b disputing and persuading the things concerning the
kingdom of God.
9 But when divers were hardened,
and believed not, but spake evil of
that way before the multitude, he
departed from them, and separated
the disciples, disputing daily in the
school of one Tyrannus.
10 And this continued by the space
of two years; so that all they which
dwelt in Asia heard the word of the
Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
11 And God wrought special a miracles by the hands of Paul:
12 So that from his body were
brought unto the sick a handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases
departed from them, and the evil
spirits went out of them.
13 ¶ Then certain of the vagabond
Jews, a exorcists, took upon them to
call over them which had evil spirits
the b name of the Lord Jesus, saying,
We c adjure you by Jesus whom Paul
preacheth.
14 And there were seven sons of
one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
priests, which did so.
15 And the a evil spirit answered
and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
know; but who are ye?
16 And the man in whom the evil
spirit was leaped on them, and over- came them, and prevailed against
them, so that they fled out of that
house naked and wounded.
17 And this was known to all the
Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
Ephesus; and fear fell on them all,
and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified.
18 And many that believed came,
and a confessed, and shewed their
deeds.
19 Many of them also which used
curious a arts brought their books
together, and burned them before
all men: and they counted the price
of them, and found it fifty thousand
pieces of silver.
20 So mightily grew the word of
God and prevailed.
21 ¶ After these things were ended,
Paul purposed in the a spirit, when
he had passed through Macedonia
and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, say- ing, After I have been there, I must
also see b Rome.
22 So he sent into Macedonia
two of them that ministered unto
him, Timotheus and Erastus; but
he himself stayed in Asia for a
season.

23 And the same time there arose
no small stir about that way.
24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
silver shrines for a Diana, brought
no small gain unto the craftsmen;
25 Whom he called together with
the workmen of like occupation,
and said, Sirs, ye know that by this
craft we have our wealth.
26 Moreover ye see and hear, that
not alone at Ephesus, but almost
throughout all Asia, this Paul hath
persuaded and turned away much
people, saying that they be no gods,
which are made with hands:
27 So that not only this our a craft
is in danger to be set at nought; but
also that the temple of the great
goddess Diana should be despised,
and her magnificence should be
destroyed, whom all Asia and the
world worshippeth.
28 And when they heard these say- ings, they were full of wrath, and
cried out, saying, Great is Diana of
the Ephesians.
29 And the whole city was filled
with confusion: and having caught
Gaius and a Aristarchus, men of
Macedonia, Paul’s companions in
travel, they rushed with one accord
into the theatre.
30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disci- ples suffered him not.
31 And certain of the chief of Asia,
which were his friends, sent unto
him, desiring him that he would not
adventure himself into the theatre.
32 Some therefore cried one thing,
and some another: for the assembly
was confused; and the more part
knew not wherefore they were come
together.
33 And they drew Alexander out of
the multitude, the Jews putting him
forward. And a Alexander beckoned
with the hand, and would have
made his defence unto the people.
34 But when they knew that he was
a Jew, all with one voice about the
space of two hours cried out, Great
is Diana of the Ephesians.
35 And when the townclerk had a appeased the people, he said, Ye
men of Ephesus, what man is there
that knoweth not how that the city
of the Ephesians is a b worshipper of
the great goddess Diana, and of the
image which fell down from c Jupiter?
36 Seeing then that these things
cannot be spoken against, ye ought to
be quiet, and to do nothing a rashly.
37 For ye have brought hither these
men, which are neither robbers of
churches, nor yet blasphemers of
your goddess.
38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the
craftsmen which are with him, have
a matter against any man, a the law
is open, and there are deputies: let
them implead one another.
39 But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be
determined in a lawful assembly.
40 For we are in danger to be called
in question for this day’s a uproar,
there being no cause whereby we
may give an account of this concourse.
41 And when he had thus spoken,
he dismissed the assembly.

2 And when he had gone over those
parts, and had given them much
exhortation, he came into Greece,
3 And there abode three months.
And when the Jews laid wait for
him, as he was about to sail into
Syria, he purposed to return through
Macedonia.
4 And there accompanied him
into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
the Thessalonians, a Aristarchus and
Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and
b Timotheus; and of Asia, c Tychicus
and d Trophimus.
5 These going before tarried for
us at Troas.
6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of a unleavened
bread, and came unto them to Troas
in five days; where we abode seven
days.
7 And upon the a first b day of the
week, when the disciples came
c together to d break e bread, Paul
preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued
his speech until midnight.
8 And there were many lights in
the upper chamber, where they were
gathered together.
9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
being fallen into a deep sleep: and
as Paul was long preaching, he sunk
down with sleep, and fell down
from the third loft, and was taken
up dead.
10 And Paul went down, and fell
on him, and a embracing him said,
Trouble not yourselves; for his life
is in him.
11 When he therefore was come up
again, and had broken bread, and
eaten, and talked a long while, even
till break of day, so he departed.
12 And they brought the young
man a alive, and were not a little
comforted.
13 ¶ And we went before to ship,
and sailed unto Assos, there in- tending to take in Paul: for so had
he appointed, minding himself to
a go afoot.
14 And when he met with us at
Assos, we took him in, and came
to Mitylene.
15 And we sailed thence, and came
the next day over against Chios;
and the next day we arrived at
Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium;
and the next day we came to Miletus.
16 For Paul had determined to
sail by Ephesus, because he would
not spend the time in Asia: for
he a hasted, if it were possible for
him, to be at Jerusalem the day of
b Pentecost.
17 ¶ And from Miletus he sent to
Ephesus, and called the a elders of
the church.
18 And when they were come to
him, he said unto them, Ye know,
from the first day that I came into
Asia, after what manner I have been
with you at all seasons,
19 a Serving the Lord with all b hu- mility of mind, and with many c tears,
and d temptations, which befell me
by the lying in wait of the Jews:
20 And how I kept back nothing
that was profitable unto you, but
have shewed you, and have taught
you publickly, and from house
to house,
21 Testifying both to the Jews,
and also to the Greeks, repentance
toward God, a and faith toward our
Lord b Jesus Christ.
22 And now, behold, I go bound
in the a spirit unto Jerusalem, not
knowing the things that shall befall me there:

23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that
bonds and a afflictions b abide me.
24 But none of these things a move
me, neither count I my b life dear
unto myself, so that I might finish
my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the
Lord Jesus, to testify the c gospel of
the d grace of God.
25 And now, behold, I know that
ye all, among whom I have gone
preaching the kingdom of God, shall
see my face no more.
26 Wherefore I take you to record
this day, that I am pure from the a blood of all men.
27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the a counsel of
God.
28 ¶ Take heed therefore unto
yourselves, and to all the a flock, over
the which the Holy Ghost hath made
you b overseers, to feed the c church
of God, which he hath purchased
with his own d blood.
29 For I know this, that after my
departing shall a grievous wolves
enter in among you, not sparing
the flock.
30 Also of your own selves shall
men arise, speaking a perverse things,
to b draw away disciples after them.
31 Therefore watch, and remember,
that by the space of three years I
ceased not to a warn every one night
and day with tears.
32 And now, brethren, I commend
you to God, and to the word of his
grace, which is able to build you
up, and to give you an a inheritance
among all them which are sanctified.
33 I have a coveted no man’s silver,
or b gold, or apparel.
34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that
these a hands have b ministered unto
my necessities, and to them that
were with me.
35 I have shewed you all things,
how that so labouring ye ought to
support the weak, and to remember
the words of the Lord Jesus, how
he said, It is more blessed to a give
than to receive.
36 ¶ And when he had thus spo- ken, he kneeled down, and prayed
with them all.
37 And they all wept sore, and fell
on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
38 a Sorrowing most of all for the
words which he spake, that they
should see his face no more. And
they accompanied him unto the ship.
Chapter 21
Paul journeys to Jerusalem—He is persecuted, arrested, and bound.
And it came to pass, that after we
were gotten from them, and had
launched, we came with a straight
course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence
unto Patara:
2 And finding a ship sailing over
unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and
set forth.
3 Now when we had discovered
Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
and sailed into Syria, and landed
at Tyre: for there the ship was to
unlade her burden.
4 And finding disciples, we tarried
there seven days: who said to Paul
through the a Spirit, that he should
not go up to Jerusalem.

those days, we departed and went

our way; and they all brought us on
our way, with wives and children,
till we were out of the city: and we
kneeled down on the shore, and
prayed.
6 And when we had taken our leave
one of another, we took ship; and
they returned home again.
7 And when we had finished our
course from Tyre, we came to Ptole- mais, and saluted the brethren, and
abode with them one day.
8 And the next day we that were of
Paul’s company departed, and came
unto a Cæsarea: and we entered into
the house of b Philip the c evangelist,
which was one of the seven; and
abode with him.
9 And the same man had four
daughters, virgins, which did
a prophesy.
10 And as we tarried there many
days, there came down from Judæa
a certain prophet, named Agabus.
11 And when he was come unto
us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound
his own hands and feet, and said,
Thus saith the a Holy Ghost, So shall
the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man
that owneth this girdle, and shall
deliver him into the hands of the
Gentiles.
12 And when we heard these
things, both we, and they of that
place, besought him not to go up to
Jerusalem.
13 Then Paul answered, What mean
ye to weep and to break mine heart?
for I am ready not to be bound only,
but also to a die at Jerusalem for the
name of the Lord Jesus.
14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The a will
of the Lord be done.
15 And after those days we a took
up our carriages, and went up to
Jerusalem.
16 There went with us also certain
of the disciples of Cæsarea, and
brought with them one Mnason of
Cyprus, an a old disciple, with whom
we should lodge.
17 And when we were come to
Jerusalem, the brethren received
us gladly.
18 And the day following Paul went
in with us unto a James; and all the
elders were present.
19 And when he had saluted them,
he declared particularly what things
God had wrought among the a Gentiles by his ministry.
20 And when they heard it, they
glorified the Lord, and said unto
him, Thou seest, brother, how many
thousands of Jews there are which
believe; and they are all a zealous
of the law:
21 And they are informed of
thee, that thou teachest all the
Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that
they ought not to a circumcise their
children, neither to walk after the
b customs.
22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for
they will hear that thou art come.
23 Do therefore this that we say to
thee: We have four men which have
a a vow on them;
24 Them take, and purify thyself
with them, and a be at charges with
them, that they may b shave their
heads: and all may know that those
things, whereof they were informed
concerning thee, are nothing; but
that thou thyself also walkest or- derly, and keepest the law.
25 As touching the Gentiles which
believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such
thing, save only that they keep
themselves from things offered to

26 Then Paul took the men, and
the next day purifying himself
with them entered into the temple,
to signify the a accomplishment of
the days of b purification, until that
an c offering should be offered for
every one of them.
27 And when the a seven days were
almost ended, the Jews which were
of Asia, when they saw him in the
temple, stirred up all the people,
and laid hands on him,
28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help:
This is the man, that teacheth all
men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and
further brought Greeks also into the
a temple, and hath b polluted this holy
place.
29 (For they had seen before with
him in the city a Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul
had brought into the temple.)
30 And all the city was moved,
and the people ran together: and
they took Paul, and drew him out
of the temple: and forthwith the
doors were shut.
31 And as they went about to a kill
him, tidings came unto the chief
captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an b uproar.
32 Who immediately took soldiers
and centurions, and ran down unto
them: and when they saw the chief
a captain and the soldiers, they left
beating of Paul.
33 Then the chief a captain came
near, and took him, and commanded
him to be bound with two chains;
and demanded who he was, and
what he had done.
34 And some cried one thing,
some another, among the multitude:
and when he could not know the
certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the
a castle.
35 And when he came upon the
stairs, so it was, that he was borne
of the soldiers for the violence of
the people.
36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
with him.
37 And as Paul was to be led into
the castle, he said unto the chief
captain, May I speak unto thee?
Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
38 Art not thou that Egyptian,
which before these days madest
an uproar, and leddest out into the
wilderness four thousand men that
were murderers?
39 But Paul said, I am a man which
am a Jew of a Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and,
I beseech thee, suffer me to speak
unto the people.
40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
a beckoned with the hand unto the
people. And when there was made
a great b silence, he spake unto them
in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
Chapter 22
Paul recounts the story of his conver- sion and also tells of seeing Jesus in a
vision—He is accorded some privileges
as a Roman citizen.
Men, brethren, and fathers, hear
ye my defence which I make now
unto you.
2 (And when they heard that he
spake in the Hebrew tongue to
them, they kept the more silence:
and he saith,)
3 I am verily a man which am a a Jew,
born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet
brought up in this city at the b feet
of c Gamaliel, and taught accord- ing to the perfect manner of the

d law of the fathers, and was e zealous
toward God, as ye all are this day.
4 And I a persecuted this way unto
the death, binding and delivering
into prisons both men and women.
5 As also the high priest doth bear
me witness, and all the estate of the
elders: from whom also I received
a letters unto the brethren, and went
to Damascus, to bring them which
were there bound unto Jerusalem,
for to be punished.
6 And it came to pass, that, as I
made my journey, and was come
nigh unto Damascus about noon,
suddenly there shone from heaven
a great a light round about me.
7 And I fell unto the ground, and
heard a voice saying unto me, a Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?
8 And I answered, Who art thou,
Lord? And he said unto me, I am
a Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
9 And they that were with me saw
indeed the light, and were afraid;
but they heard not the a voice of him
that spake to me.
10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord?
And the Lord said unto me, Arise,
and go into Damascus; and there it
shall be told thee of all things which
are appointed for thee to do.
11 And when I could not see for
the glory of that light, being led by
the hand of them that were with
me, I came into Damascus.
12 And one a Ananias, a devout
man according to the law, having a
good b report of all the Jews which
dwelt there,
13 Came unto me, and stood, and
said unto me, Brother Saul, receive
thy a sight. And the same hour I
looked up upon him.
14 And he said, The God of our
fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
shouldest know his a will, and see
that Just One, and shouldest hear
the voice of his mouth.
15 For thou shalt be his a witness
unto all men of what thou hast seen
and heard.
16 And now why tarriest thou?
arise, and be a baptized, and b wash
away thy sins, calling on the name
of the Lord.
17 And it came to pass, that, when
I was come again to Jerusalem, even
while I prayed in the temple, I was
in a a trance;
18 And a saw him saying unto me,
Make haste, and get thee quickly out
of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
19 And I said, Lord, they know that
I a imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
20 And when the blood of thy a martyr Stephen was shed, I also was
standing by, and b consenting unto
his death, and kept the c raiment of
them that slew him.
21 And he said unto me, Depart:
for I will send thee far hence unto
the a Gentiles.
22 And they gave him a audience
unto this word, and then lifted up
their voices, and said, Away with
such a fellow from the earth: for it
is not fit that he should live.
23 And as they cried out, and cast
off their clothes, and threw dust
into the air,
24 The chief captain commanded
him to be brought into the a castle,
and bade that he should be examined by b scourging; that he might
know wherefore they cried so
against him.

25 And as they bound him with
thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
that stood by, Is it lawful for you
to scourge a man that is a a Roman,
and uncondemned?
26 When the centurion heard that,
he went and told the chief captain,
saying, Take heed what thou doest:
for this man is a Roman.
27 Then the chief captain came,
and said unto him, Tell me, art thou
a Roman? He said, Yea.
28 And the a chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained
I this freedom. And Paul said, But
I was free born.
29 a Then straightway they departed from him which should have
examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew
that he was a Roman, and because
he had bound him.
30 On the morrow, because he
would have known the certainty
wherefore he was a accused of the
Jews, he loosed him from his bands,
and commanded the chief priests
and all their council to appear, and
brought Paul down, and set him
before them.
Chapter 23
Paul is smitten at Ananias’s order—
The Lord again appears to Paul—Forty
Jews plot his death—He is delivered
over to Felix.
And Paul, earnestly beholding the
council, said, Men and brethren, I
have lived in all good a conscience
before God until this day.
2 And the high priest a Ananias
commanded them that stood by him
to b smite him on the mouth.
3 Then said Paul unto him, God
shall smite thee, thou a whited wall:
for sittest thou to judge me after
the law, and commandest me to be
smitten contrary to the law?
4 And they that stood by said, a Revilest thou God’s high priest?
5 Then said Paul, I a wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for
it is written, Thou shalt not speak
evil of the b ruler of thy people.
6 But when Paul perceived that
the one part were Sadducees, and
the other Pharisees, he cried out
in the council, Men and brethren, I
am a a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the b hope and c resurrection
of the dead I am called in question.
7 And when he had so said, there
arose a dissension between the
Pharisees and the Sadducees: and
the multitude was divided.
8 For the a Sadducees say that there
is no b resurrection, neither angel,
nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
9 And there arose a great cry: and
the a scribes that were of the Phari- sees’ part arose, and strove, saying,
We find no evil in this man: but if
a spirit or an b angel hath spoken to
him, let us not c fight against God.
10 And when there arose a great
dissension, the chief captain, fearing
lest Paul should have been pulled
in pieces of them, commanded
the soldiers to go down, and to
take him by force from among
them, and to bring him into the
castle.
11 And the night following the a Lord b stood by him, and said, Be
of good c cheer, Paul: for as thou
hast testified of me in Jerusalem,
so must thou bear witness also at
d Rome.
12 And when it was day, certain
of the Jews banded together, and

bound themselves under a a curse,
saying that they would neither eat
nor drink till they had b killed Paul.
13 And they were more than forty
which had made this a conspiracy.
14 And they came to the chief
priests and elders, and said, We
have bound ourselves under a great
curse, that we will eat nothing until
we have slain Paul.
15 Now therefore ye with the coun- cil signify to the chief captain that
he bring him down unto you to
morrow, as though ye would inquire
something more perfectly concerning him: and we, a or ever he come
near, are ready to kill him.
16 And when Paul’s sister’s son
heard of their lying in wait, he
went and entered into the castle,
and told Paul.
17 Then Paul called one of the
centurions unto him, and said, Bring
this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to
tell him.
18 So he took him, and brought
him to the chief captain, and said,
Paul the prisoner called me unto
him, and prayed me to bring this
young man unto thee, who hath
something to say unto thee.
19 Then the chief captain took
him by the hand, and went with
him aside privately, and asked him,
What is that thou hast to tell me?
20 And he said, The Jews have
agreed to desire thee that thou
wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they
would inquire somewhat of him
more perfectly.
21 But do not thou yield unto them:
for there lie in wait for him of them
more than forty men, which have
bound themselves with an a oath,
that they will neither eat nor drink
till they have killed him: and now
are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
22 So the chief captain then let the
young man depart, and charged
him, See thou tell no man that
thou hast shewed these things
to me.
23 And he called unto him two
centurions, saying, Make ready two
hundred soldiers to go to Cæsarea,
and horsemen threescore and ten,
and spearmen two hundred, at the
third hour of the night;
24 And provide them beasts, that
they may set Paul on, and bring him
safe unto Felix the governor.
25 And he wrote a letter after this
manner:
26 Claudius a Lysias unto the most
excellent governor Felix sendeth
greeting.
27 This man was taken of the Jews,
and a should have been killed of
them: then came I with an b army,
and rescued him, having understood
that he was a c Roman.
28 And when I would have known
the cause wherefore they a accused
him, I brought him forth into their
council:
29 Whom I perceived to be accused
of a questions of their law, but to have
nothing laid to his charge worthy
of b death or of bonds.
30 And when it was told me how
that the Jews laid wait for the man,
I sent a straightway to thee, and gave
commandment to his accusers also
to say before thee what they had
against him. Farewell.
31 Then the soldiers, as it was
commanded them, took Paul, and
brought him by night to Antipatris.
32 On the morrow they left the
horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
33 Who, when they came to
Cæsarea, and delivered the epistle
to the governor, presented Paul also
before him.

read the letter, he asked of what

he commanded him to be kept in

Chapter 24
Paul is accused of sedition—He answers
in defense of his life and doctrine—He
teaches Felix of righteousness, temperance, and the judgment to come.
And after five days a Ananias the
high priest descended with the el- ders, and with a certain orator named
Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
2 And when he was called forth,
Tertullus began to accuse him, say- ing, Seeing that by thee we enjoy
great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation
by thy providence,
3 We accept it always, and in all
places, most noble Felix, with all
thankfulness.
4 Notwithstanding, that I be not
further tedious unto thee, I pray
thee that thou wouldest hear us of
thy clemency a few words.
5 For we have found this man a
pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedi- tion among all the Jews throughout
the world, and a ringleader of the
sect of the Nazarenes:
6 Who also hath gone about to pro- fane the a temple: whom we took,
and would have judged according
to our law.
7 But the chief a captain Lysias
came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our
hands,
8 Commanding his accusers to
come unto thee: by examining of
whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we
accuse him.
9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
speak, answered, Forasmuch as I
know that thou hast been of many
years a judge unto this nation, I
do the more cheerfully answer for
myself:
11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve
days since I went up to Jerusalem
for to worship.
12 And they neither found me
in the temple a disputing with any
man, neither raising up the peo- ple, neither in the synagogues, nor
in the city:
13 Neither can they prove the
things whereof they now accuse me.
14 But this I confess unto thee,
that after the way which they call
heresy, so worship I the God of my
fathers, believing all things which
are written in the law and in the
a prophets:
15 And have hope toward God,
which they themselves also allow,
that there shall be a a resurrection of
the dead, both of the just and unjust.
16 And herein do I exercise myself,
to have always a a conscience void of
offence toward God, and toward men.
17 Now after many years I came
to bring a alms to my nation, and
offerings.
18 Whereupon certain Jews from
Asia found me a purified in the
temple, neither with multitude, nor
with tumult.
19 Who ought to have been here
before thee, and object, if they had
ought against me.
20 Or else let these same here say,
if they have found any evil doing in
me, while I stood before the council,

that I cried standing among them,

22 And when Felix heard these
things, having more perfect knowl- edge of that way, he deferred them,
and said, When a Lysias the chief
captain shall come down, I will
know the uttermost of your matter.
23 And he commanded a centurion
to keep Paul, and to let him have
liberty, and that he should forbid
none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
24 And after certain days, when
Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul,
and heard him concerning the faith
in Christ.
25 And as he reasoned of righ- teousness, a temperance, and judgment to come, Felix b trembled, and
answered, Go thy way for this time;
when I have a convenient season, I
will call for thee.
26 He hoped also that a money
should have been given him of Paul,
that he might loose him: wherefore
he sent for him the oftener, and
communed with him.
27 But after two years Porcius Fes- tus came into Felix’ room: and Felix,
willing to shew the Jews a pleasure,
left Paul bound.
Chapter 25
Paul, before Festus, appeals unto
Cæsar—Agrippa desires to hear Paul.
Now when Festus was come into
the province, after three days he ascended from Cæsarea to Jerusalem.
2 Then the high priest and the chief
of the Jews informed him against
Paul, and besought him,
3 And desired favour against him,
that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to
a kill him.
4 But Festus answered, that Paul
should be kept at Cæsarea, and that
he himself would depart shortly
thither.
5 Let them therefore, said he, which
among you are able, go down with
me, and accuse this man, if there be
any a wickedness in him.
6 And when he had tarried among
them more than ten days, he went
down unto Cæsarea; and the next
day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought.
7 And when he was come, the Jews
which came down from Jerusalem
stood round about, and laid many
and grievous complaints against
Paul, which they could not prove.
8 While he answered for himself,
Neither against the law of the Jews,
neither against the temple, nor yet
against Cæsar, have I offended any
thing at all.
9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews
a pleasure, answered Paul, and said,
Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and
there be judged of these things before me?
10 Then said Paul, I stand at
Cæsar’s judgment seat, where I
ought to be judged: to the Jews have
I done no wrong, as thou very well
knowest.
11 For if I be an offender, or have
committed any thing worthy of
death, I refuse not to die: but if there
be none of these things whereof
these accuse me, no man may de- liver me unto them. I appeal unto
a Cæsar.
12 Then Festus, when he had con- ferred with the council, answered,
Hast thou appealed unto Cæsar?
unto Cæsar shalt thou go.
13 And after certain days king
Agrippa and Bernice came unto
Cæsarea to salute Festus.
14 And when they had been there
many days, Festus declared Paul’s
cause unto the king, saying, There
is a certain man left in bonds by
Felix:
15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.

16 To whom I answered, It is not
the manner of the Romans to de- liver any man to die, before that he
which is accused have the accusers
face to face, and have licence to
answer for himself concerning the
crime laid against him.
17 Therefore, when they were
come hither, without any delay on
the morrow I sat on the judgment
seat, and commanded the man to
be brought forth.
18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought
none accusation of such things as I
supposed:
19 But had certain questions against
him of their own a superstition, and
of one Jesus, which was dead, whom
Paul affirmed to be alive.
20 And because I a doubted of such
manner of questions, I asked him
whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
matters.
21 But when Paul had appealed
to be reserved unto the hearing of
Augustus, I commanded him to be
kept till I might send him to Cæsar.
22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus,
I would also hear the man myself.
To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear
him.
23 And on the morrow, when
Agrippa was come, and Bernice,
with great pomp, and was entered
into the place of hearing, with the
chief captains, and principal men
of the city, at Festus’ commandment
Paul was brought forth.
24 And Festus said, King Agrippa,
and all men which are here present
with us, ye see this man, about whom
all the multitude of the Jews have
dealt with me, both at Jerusalem,
and also here, crying that he ought
not to live any longer.
25 But when I found that he
had committed nothing worthy of
a death, and that he himself hath
appealed to Augustus, I have deter- mined to send him.
26 Of whom I have no certain thing
to write unto my lord. Wherefore I
have brought him forth before you,
and specially before thee, O king
Agrippa, that, after examination
had, I might have somewhat to write.
27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
withal to signify the crimes laid
against him.
Chapter 26
Paul recounts his former persecution
of the Saints as a Pharisee—He testi- fies of the appearance of Jesus on the
Damascus road—Paul bears his testimony to King Agrippa.
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou
art permitted to speak for thyself.
Then Paul stretched forth the hand,
and answered for himself:
2 I think myself happy, king
Agrippa, because I shall answer for
myself this day before thee touching
all the things whereof I am accused
of the Jews:
3 Especially because I know thee to
be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews:
wherefore I beseech thee to hear
me patiently.
4 My manner of life from my youth,
which was at the first among mine
own nation at Jerusalem, know all
the Jews;
5 Which knew me from the be- ginning, if they would testify, that
after the most straitest sect of our
religion I lived a a Pharisee.
6 And now I stand and am judged
for the hope of the promise made
of God unto our fathers:
7 Unto which promise our a twelve
tribes, b instantly serving God day
and night, hope to come. For which
hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

8 Why should it be thought a thing
incredible with you, that God should
a raise the dead?
9 I verily thought with myself, that
I ought to do many things a contrary
to the b name of Jesus of Nazareth.
10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the a saints did
I shut up in prison, having received
authority from the chief priests;
and when they were put to b death,
I gave my c voice against them.
11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
to blaspheme; and being exceedingly
mad against them, I persecuted them
even unto a strange cities.
12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
from the chief priests,
13 At midday, O king, I saw in the
way a a light from heaven, above
the brightness of the sun, shining
round about me and them which
journeyed with me.
14 And when we were all fallen to
the earth, I heard a voice speaking
unto me, and saying in the Hebrew
tongue, a Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me? it is hard for thee to kick b against the pricks.
15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord?
And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest.
16 But rise, and stand upon thy
feet: for I have a appeared unto
thee for this purpose, to make thee
a minister and a b witness both of
these things which thou hast seen,
and of those things in the which I
will appear unto thee;
17 Delivering thee from the people,
and from the Gentiles, unto whom
now I a send thee,
18 To open their eyes, and to turn
them from a darkness to b light, and
from the power of Satan unto God,
that they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance among them
which are sanctified by faith that
is in me.
19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I
was not a disobedient unto the heavenly b vision:
20 But shewed first unto them of
Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
throughout all the coasts of Judæa,
and then to the Gentiles, that they
should repent and turn to God, and
do works meet for repentance.
21 For these causes the Jews caught
me in the temple, and went about
to a kill me.
22 Having therefore obtained help
of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and great,
saying none other things than those
which the a prophets and Moses did
say should come:
23 That Christ should a suffer, and
that he should be the first that
should b rise from the dead, and
should shew light unto the people,
and to the Gentiles.
24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much
learning doth make thee a mad.
25 But he said, I am not mad, most
noble Festus; but speak forth the
words of truth and soberness.
26 For the king knoweth of these
things, before whom also I speak
freely: for I am persuaded that none
of these things are hidden from
him; for this thing was not done in
a corner.

the prophets? I know that thou

28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul,
Almost thou a persuadest me to be
a b Christian.
29 And Paul said, I would to God,
that not only thou, but also all that
hear me this day, were both almost,
and altogether such as I am, except
these bonds.
30 And when he had thus spoken,
the king rose up, and the governor,
and Bernice, and they that sat with
them:
31 And when they were gone aside,
they talked between themselves,
saying, This man doeth nothing
worthy of a death or of bonds.
32 Then said Agrippa unto Fes- tus, This man might have been set
at liberty, if he had not appealed
unto a Cæsar.
Chapter 27
Paul, in a perilous voyage, travels toward
Rome—An angel comforts him—He uses
the gift of seership—He is shipwrecked.
And when it was determined that we
should sail into Italy, they delivered
Paul and certain other prisoners
unto one named Julius, a centurion
of Augustus’ band.
2 And entering into a ship of
Adramyttium, we launched, mean- ing to sail by the coasts of Asia; one a Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thes- salonica, being with us.
3 And the next day we touched at
Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty
to go unto his friends to refresh
himself.
4 And when we had launched from
thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
because the winds were contrary.
5 And when we had sailed over
the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
6 And there the centurion found
a ship of Alexandria sailing into
Italy; and he put us therein.
7 And when we had sailed slowly
many days, and scarce were come
over against Cnidus, the wind not
suffering us, we sailed under Crete,
over against Salmone;
8 And, hardly passing it, came
unto a place which is called The
fair havens; nigh whereunto was
the city of Lasea.
9 Now when much time was spent,
and when sailing was now danger- ous, because the a fast was now al- ready past, Paul admonished them,
10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with
hurt and much damage, not only
of the lading and ship, but also of
our lives.
11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the a owner
of the ship, more than those things
which were spoken by Paul.
12 And because the haven was
not commodious to winter in, the
more part advised to depart thence
also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter;
which is an haven of Crete, and lieth
toward the south west and north
west.
13 And when the south wind blew
softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence,
they sailed close by Crete.
14 But not long after there arose
against it a tempestuous wind, called
Euroclydon.
15 And when the ship was caught,
and could not bear up into the wind,
we let her drive.
16 And running under a certain
island which is called Clauda, we
had much work to come by the
boat:
17 Which when they had taken up,
they used helps, undergirding the
ship; and, fearing lest they should
fall into the quicksands, strake sail,
and so were driven.
18 And we being exceedingly
tossed with a tempest, the next day
they lightened the ship;

19 And the third day we cast out
with our own hands the tackling
of the ship.
20 And when neither sun nor stars
in many days appeared, and no
small tempest lay on us, all hope
that we should be saved was then
taken away.
21 But after long abstinence Paul
stood forth in the midst of them,
and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed
from Crete, and to have gained this
harm and loss.
22 And now I exhort you to be of
good cheer: for there shall be no
loss of any man’s a life among you,
but of the ship.
23 For there stood by me this night
the a angel of God, whose I am, and
whom I serve,
24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must
be brought before Cæsar: and, lo,
God hath given thee all them that
sail with thee.
25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good
cheer: for I believe God, that it shall
be even as it was told me.
26 Howbeit we must be cast upon
a certain island.
27 But when the fourteenth night
was come, as we were driven up and
down in a Adria, about midnight the
shipmen deemed that they drew
near to some country;
28 And sounded, and found it
twenty fathoms: and when they had
gone a little further, they sounded
again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
29 Then fearing lest we should
have fallen upon rocks, they cast
four anchors out of the stern, and
wished for the day.
30 And as the shipmen were about
to flee out of the ship, when they
had let down the boat into the sea,
under colour as though they would
have cast anchors out of the foreship,
31 Paul said to the centurion and
to the soldiers, Except these abide
in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
32 Then the soldiers cut off the
ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
33 And while the day was coming
on, Paul besought them all to take
meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and
continued a fasting, having taken
nothing.
34 Wherefore I pray you to take
some meat: for this is for your a health:
for there shall not an hair fall from
the head of any of you.
35 And when he had thus spoken,
he took bread, and gave thanks to
God in presence of them all: and
when he had broken it, he began
to eat.
36 Then were they all of good cheer,
and they also took some meat.
37 And we were in all in the ship
two hundred threescore and six- teen souls.
38 And when they had eaten
enough, they lightened the ship,
and cast out the wheat into the sea.
39 And when it was day, they knew
not the land: but they discovered
a certain a creek with a shore, into
the which they were minded, if it
were possible, to thrust in the ship.
40 And when they had a taken up
the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the
rudder bands, and hoised up the
mainsail to the wind, and made
toward shore.
41 And falling into a place where
two seas met, they ran the ship
aground; and the forepart stuck fast,
and remained unmoveable, but the
hinder part was broken with the
violence of the waves.
42 And the soldiers’ counsel was to
kill the prisoners, lest any of them
should swim out, and escape.
43 But the centurion, willing to
save Paul, kept them from their
purpose; and commanded that they
which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:

they escaped all a safe to land.
Chapter 28
Paul is unharmed by a viper’s bite—He
heals the sick in Melita—He preaches
in Rome, first to the Jews and then to
the Gentiles.
And when they were escaped, then
they knew that the island was called
Melita.
2 And the a barbarous people
shewed us no little b kindness: for
they kindled a fire, and received us
every one, because of the present
rain, and because of the cold.
3 And when Paul had gathered a
bundle of sticks, and laid them on
the fire, there came a a viper out of
the heat, and fastened on his hand.
4 And when the barbarians saw the
venomous beast hang on his hand,
they said among themselves, No
doubt this man is a murderer, whom,
though he hath escaped the sea, yet
vengeance suffereth not to live.
5 And he shook off the beast into
the fire, and felt no a harm.
6 Howbeit they looked when he
should have swollen, or fallen down
dead suddenly: but after they had
looked a great while, and saw no
harm come to him, they changed
their minds, and said that he was
a a god.
7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island,
whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days
a courteously.
8 And it came to pass, that the
father of Publius lay a sick of a fever
and of a b bloody flux: to whom Paul
entered in, and prayed, and laid
his c hands on him, and healed him.
9 So when this was done, others
also, which had diseases in the is- land, came, and were healed:
10 Who also honoured us with
many honours; and when we de- parted, they laded us with such
things as were necessary.
11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which
had wintered in the isle, whose sign
was Castor and Pollux.
12 And landing at Syracuse, we
tarried there three days.
13 And from thence we a fetched
a compass, and came to Rhegium:
and after one day the south wind
blew, and we came the next day to
Puteoli:
14 Where we found brethren, and
were desired to tarry with them
seven days: and so we went toward
Rome.
15 And from thence, when the
brethren heard of us, they came to
meet us as far as Appii forum, and
The three taverns: whom when Paul
saw, he a thanked God, and took b courage.
16 And when we came to Rome, the
centurion delivered the prisoners to
the captain of the guard: but Paul
was suffered to dwell by himself
with a soldier that kept him.
17 And it came to pass, that after
three days Paul called the chief of
the Jews together: and when they
were come together, he said unto
them, Men and brethren, though I
have committed nothing against the
people, or customs of our fathers, yet
was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
18 Who, when they had examined
me, would have let me go, because
there was no cause of death in me.
19 But when the Jews spake against
it, I was constrained to appeal unto
Cæsar; not that I had ought to ac- cuse my nation of.

I called for you, to see you, and to

the a hope of Israel I am bound with
this chain.
21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judæa
concerning thee, neither any of the
brethren that came shewed or spake
any harm of thee.
22 But we desire to hear of thee
what thou thinkest: for as concern­ ing this sect, we know that every

23 And when they had appointed
him a day, there came many to
him into his lodging; to whom he a expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law
of Moses, and out of the b prophets,
from morning till evening.
24 And some believed the things
which were spoken, and some a believed not.
25 And when they agreed not
among themselves, they departed,
after that Paul had spoken one
word, Well a spake the Holy Ghost
by Esaias the prophet unto our
fathers,
26 Saying, Go unto this people, and
say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall
not understand; and seeing ye shall
see, and not a perceive:
27 For the a heart of this people is
waxed gross, and their ears are dull
of hearing, and their b eyes have they
closed; lest they should see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart, and
should be converted, and I should
heal them.
28 Be it known therefore unto you,
that the salvation of God is sent
unto the a Gentiles, and that they
will hear it.
29 And when he had said these
words, the Jews departed, and had
great reasoning among themselves.
30 And Paul dwelt two whole years
in his own hired house, and received
all that came in unto him,
31 Preaching the kingdom of
God, and teaching those things
which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,
with all confidence, no man forbid­ ding him.

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle
to the
Romans
Chapter 1
The gospel is the power of God unto
salvation through Jesus Christ—The
wrath of God rests on those guilty of
murder, homosexual practices, fornication, and other sins if the guilty do not
repent.
Paul, a a servant of Jesus Christ,
called to be an b apostle, c separated unto the gospel of God,
Romans 1:2–20 1416
2 (Which he had promised afore by
his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
3 Concerning his Son a Jesus Christ
our Lord, which was made of the
b seed of c David according to the
flesh;
4 And a declared to be the b Son of
God with c power, according to the
spirit of holiness, by the resurrec- tion d from the dead:
5 By whom we have received a grace
and apostleship, b for c obedience to
the faith among all nations, for his
name:
6 Among whom are ye also the
called of Jesus Christ:
7 To all that be in Rome, beloved
of God, called to be a saints: Grace to
you and peace from God our Father,
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
8 First, I thank my God through
Jesus Christ for you all, that your
a faith is b spoken of throughout the
whole world.
9 For God is my witness, whom I
serve with my spirit in the gospel
of his Son, that without ceasing
I make mention of you always in
my prayers;
10 Making request, if by any means
now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God
to come unto you.
11 For I long to see you, that I may
impart unto you some spiritual a gift,
to the end ye may be established;
12 That is, that I may be a comforted
together with you by the mutual
faith both of you and me.
13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes
I purposed to come unto you, (but
was a let hitherto,) that I might have
some b fruit among you also, even as
among other Gentiles.
14 I am debtor both to the Greeks,
and to the a Barbarians; both to the
wise, and to the unwise.
15 So, as much as in me is, I am a ready to preach the gospel to you
that are at Rome also.
16 For I am not a ashamed of the b gospel of Christ: for it is the c power
of God unto d salvation to every one
that believeth; to the Jew first, and
also to the Greek.
17 For therein is the a righteousness of God revealed b from faith to
faith: as it is written, The just shall
live by c faith.
18 For the a wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness
and unrighteousness of men, b who c hold the truth in d unrighteousness;
19 Because that which may be
known of God is manifest a in them;
for God hath shewed it unto them.

from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by
the things that are made, even his b eternal c power and Godhead; so
that they are without excuse:
21 Because that, when they knew
God, they glorified him not as God,
neither were a thankful; but became b vain in their imaginations, and
their c foolish heart was d darkened.
22 Professing themselves to be a wise, they became fools,
23 And changed the glory of the a uncorruptible God into an b image
made like to c corruptible man, and
to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and
creeping things.
24 Wherefore God also a gave them
up to b uncleanness through the
lusts of their own hearts, to dis- honour their own bodies between
themselves:
25 Who changed the truth of God
into a lie, and worshipped and served
the creature more than the Creator,
who is blessed for ever. Amen.
26 For this cause God a gave them
up unto b vile c affections: for even
their d women did change the natural use into that which is against
nature:
27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their a lust one toward an- other; men with men working that
which is unseemly, and receiving
in themselves that recompence of
their error which was meet.
28 And even as they did not like
to a retain God in their knowledge,
God b gave them over to a c reprobate
mind, to do those things which are
not convenient;
29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, a wickedness,
covetousness, b maliciousness; full
of envy, murder, c debate, d deceit,
malignity; whisperers,
30 a Backbiters, haters of God, b de- spiteful, c proud, d boasters, inventors of evil things, e disobedient to
parents,
31 Without a understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural
affection, implacable, unmerciful:
32 Who knowing the judgment of
God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of a death, not only
do the same, but b have c pleasure in
them that do them.
Chapter 2
God will render to every person according to his or her deeds—Both Jews and
Gentiles will be judged by gospel laws.
Therefore thou art inexcusable,
O man, whosoever thou art that

another, thou condemnest thyself;
for thou that judgest doest the same
things.

3 And thinkest thou this, O man,
that a judgest them which do such
things, and doest the same, that
thou shalt escape the b judgment
of God?
4 Or despisest thou the a riches of
his b goodness and c forbearance and
longsuffering; not knowing that the
goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
5 But a after thy b hardness and im- penitent heart treasurest up unto
thyself wrath against the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
6 Who will a render to every man b according to his c deeds:
7 To them who by a patient b continuance in well doing seek for glory
and honour and c immortality, eternal life:
8 But unto them that are a contentious, and do not b obey the truth,
but obey unrighteousness, c indig- nation and wrath,
9 a Tribulation and b anguish, upon
every soul of man that doeth evil,
of the Jew first, and also of the
c Gentile;
10 But glory, honour, and a peace,
to every man that b worketh good,
to the Jew first, and also to the
c Gentile:
11 For there is no a respect of b per- sons with God.
12 For as many as have sinned
without a law shall also perish
without law: and as many as have
sinned in the law shall be judged by
the law;
13 (For not the hearers of the law
are just before God, but the a doers
of the law shall be b justified.
14 For when the Gentiles, which
have not the law, do by nature the
things contained in the law, these,
having not the law, are a law unto
themselves:
15 a Which shew the work of the b law written in their hearts, their
c conscience also bearing d witness,
and their thoughts the mean while
accusing or else excusing one another;)
16 In the day when God shall a judge
the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
according to my b gospel.
17 Behold, thou art called a Jew,
and restest in the law, and makest
thy boast of God,
18 And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
excellent, being instructed out of
the law;
19 And art confident that thou
thyself art a guide of the blind, a
light of them which are in darkness,
20 An instructor of the foolish, a
teacher of babes, which hast the
a form of knowledge and of the truth
in the law.

not commit a adultery, dost thou
commit adultery ? thou that ab- horrest idols, dost thou b commit c sacrilege?
23 Thou that makest thy boast of
the law, through breaking the law
dishonourest thou God?
24 For the name of God is a blasphemed among the Gentiles through
you, as it is written.
25 For a circumcision verily prof- iteth, if thou keep the law: but if
thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
26 Therefore if the uncircumci- sion keep the righteousness of the
law, shall not his uncircumcision be
counted for circumcision?
27 And shall not uncircumcision
which is by nature, if it fulfil the
law, judge thee, who by the letter
and circumcision dost transgress
the law?
28 For he is not a Jew, which is one
outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
29 But he is a Jew, which is one
inwardly; and a circumcision is that
of the heart, in the b spirit, and not
in the letter; whose praise is not of
men, but of God.
Chapter 3
Man is not justified by the law of Mo- ses—He is justified through righteousness, which comes through faith in
Christ, made possible through Christ’s
atoning sacrifice.
a What b advantage then hath the
Jew? or what profit is there of c circumcision?
2 Much every way: chiefly, because
that unto them were committed the
a oracles of God.
3 For what if some did not believe?
shall their a unbelief make the faith
of God without effect?
4 a God forbid: yea, let God be true,
but every man a b liar; as it is written,
That thou mightest be c justified in
thy sayings, and mightest overcome
when thou art judged.
5 a But if our unrighteousness b commend the righteousness of God, what
shall we say ? Is God c unrighteous
who taketh vengeance? (I speak as
a man)
6 a God forbid: for then how shall
God b judge the world?
7 For if the truth of God hath more
abounded a through my lie unto his
glory; why yet am I also judged as
a sinner?
8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm
that we say,) Let us do evil, that
good may come? whose a damnation
is just.
9 What then? are we better than
they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles,
that they are all under sin;
10 As it is written, There is a none b righteous, no, not one:
11 There is none that understand- eth, there is none that seeketh
after God.
12 They are all gone out of the a way, they are together become b unprofitable; there is none that doeth
c good, no, not one.

used deceit; the b poison of asps is
under their lips:
14 Whose mouth is full of cursing
and a bitterness:
15 Their feet are swift to a shed
blood:
16 Destruction and a misery are in
their ways:
17 And the way of a peace have
they not known:
18 There is no a fear of God before
their eyes.
19 Now we know that what things
soever the law saith, it saith to them
who are under the law: that every
a mouth may be stopped, and all
the world may become b guilty before God.
20 Therefore by the a deeds of the b law there shall no flesh be c justified in his sight: for d by the law is
the knowledge of sin.
21 But now the a righteousness of
God b without the law is manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the
prophets;
22 Even the righteousness of God
which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
all and upon all them that believe:
for there is no difference:
23 For all have a sinned, and come
short of the glory of God;
24 a Being b justified freely by his c grace through the d redemption that
is in Christ Jesus:
25 Whom God hath a set forth to
be a b propitiation through faith in
his c blood, to declare his righteousness for the d remission of sins that
are past, through the e forbearance
of God;
26 To declare, I say, at this time
his righteousness: that he might be
a just, and the justifier of him which
believeth in Jesus.
27 Where is a boasting then? It is
excluded. By what law? of works?
Nay: but by the law of faith.
28 Therefore we conclude that a
man is a justified by b faith c without
the deeds of the law.
29 Is he the a God of the Jews only ?
is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes,
of the b Gentiles also:
30 Seeing it is a one God, which
shall justify the b circumcision by
faith, and uncircumcision through
faith.
31 Do we then make void the law
through faith? a God forbid: b yea,
we establish the law.

Abraham a believed God, and it was
counted unto him for b righteousness.
4 Now to him that worketh is the a reward not b reckoned of grace,
but of debt.
5 But to him that worketh not, but
believeth on him that justifieth the
ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness.
6 Even as David also describeth
the blessedness of the man, unto
whom God imputeth righteousness
without works,
7 Saying, a Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose
sins are covered.
8 Blessed is the man to whom the
Lord will not impute sin.
9 Cometh this blessedness then
upon the circumcision only, or upon
the uncircumcision also? for we say
that faith was reckoned to Abraham
for righteousness.
10 How was it then reckoned? when
he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but
in uncircumcision.
11 And he received the a sign of b circumcision, a seal of the righ- teousness of the faith which he had
yet being uncircumcised: that he
might be the c father of all them that
believe, though they be not circum- cised; that righteousness might be
imputed unto them also:
12 And the father of circumcision
to them who are not of the circum- cision only, but who also a walk in
the steps of that faith of our father
Abraham, which he had being yet
uncircumcised.
13 For the promise, that he should
be the a heir of the world, was not to
Abraham, or to his b seed, through
the law, but through the righteous- ness of faith.
14 For if they which are of the law
be heirs, faith is made void, and the
promise made of none effect:
15 Because the law worketh wrath:
for where no a law is, there is no b transgression.
16 a Therefore it is of faith, that
it might be by b grace; to the end the
promise might be sure to all the
seed; not to that only which is of
the law, but to that also which is
of the c faith of Abraham; who is the d father of us all,
17 (As it is written, I have made
thee a father of many nations,) be- fore him whom he believed, even
God, who a quickeneth the dead,
and calleth those things which be
not as though they were.
18 Who against hope believed in a hope, that he might become the
father of many b nations, according
to that which was spoken, So shall
thy c seed be.
19 And being not weak in faith,
he considered not his own body
now dead, when he was about an
hundred years a old, neither yet the
deadness of Sara’s womb:
20 He a staggered not at the prom- ise of God through unbelief; but
was strong in faith, giving glory
to God;
21 And being fully persuaded that,
what he had a promised, he was able
also to perform.
22 And therefore it was imputed
to him for righteousness.

shall be imputed, if we believe on
him that raised up Jesus our Lord
from the dead;

Chapter 5
Man is justified through the blood of
Christ—Adam fell, and Christ atoned
that man might be saved.
Therefore being a justified by b faith, we have c peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ:
2 By whom also we have access by a faith into this grace wherein we
stand, and rejoice in hope of the
glory of God.
3 And not only so, but we glory
in a tribulations also: knowing that b tribulation worketh c patience;
4 And patience, experience; and
experience, hope:
5 And a hope maketh not ashamed;
because the b love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost which is given unto us.
6 For when we were yet without a strength, in due time Christ died
for the ungodly.
7 For scarcely for a righteous man
will one die: yet peradventure for
a good man some would even dare
to die.
8 But God commendeth his love
toward us, in that, while we were
yet a sinners, b Christ died for us.
9 Much more then, being now a justified by his b blood, we shall
be saved from wrath through him.
10 For if, when we were enemies,
we were a reconciled to God by the b death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved
by his life.
11 And not only so, but we also
joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom we have now received the a atonement.
12 Wherefore, as by one man a sin
entered into the world, and b death
by sin; and so c death passed upon
all men, for that all have d sinned:
13 (For until the law sin was in
the world: but a sin is not imputed
when there is no b law.
14 Nevertheless death reigned from
Adam to Moses, even over them that
had not sinned after the similitude
of Adam’s a transgression, who is the b figure of him that was to come.
15 But not as the offence, so also
is the free gift. For if through the
offence of one many be dead, much
more the grace of God, and the gift
by grace, which is by a one man,
Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto
many.
16 And not as it was by one that
sinned, so is the gift: for the judg- ment was by one to condemnation,
but the free gift is of many offences
unto justification.
17 For if by one man’s offence death
reigned by one; much more they
which receive abundance of a grace
and of the gift of righteousness shall
reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

one judgment came upon all men to
condemnation; even so by the a righteousness of one the free gift came
upon all men unto b justification
of life.
19 For as by one man’s a disobedience many were made sinners, so
by the b obedience of one shall many
be made righteous.
20 Moreover the law entered, that
the offence might abound. But
where sin abounded, grace did much
more abound:
21 That as sin hath reigned unto
death, even so might grace reign
through a righteousness unto b eter- nal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
Chapter 6
Baptism is in similitude of the death,
burial, and resurrection of Christ—The
wages of sin is death—Christ brings
eternal life.
What shall we say then? Shall we
continue in sin, that a grace may
abound?
2 a God forbid. How shall we, that
are dead to b sin, live any longer
therein?
3 Know ye not, that so many of us
as were a baptized into Jesus Christ
were baptized into his death?
4 Therefore we are a buried with
him by b baptism into death: that
like as Christ was raised up from
the c dead by the glory of the Father,
even so we also should d walk in e newness of life.
5 For if we have been planted together in the a likeness of his b death,
we shall be also in the likeness of his c resurrection:
6 Knowing this, that our a old man
is crucified with him, that the b body
of sin might be c destroyed, that
henceforth we should not serve
d sin.
7 For he that is a dead is b freed
from sin.
8 Now if we be a dead with Christ,
we believe that we shall also live
with him:
9 Knowing that Christ being a raised
from the dead dieth no more;
death hath no more dominion over
him.
10 For in that he died, he died unto a sin b once: but in that he liveth, he
liveth unto God.
11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
but a alive unto God through Jesus
Christ our Lord.
12 Let not sin therefore reign in
your a mortal body, that ye should
obey it in the b lusts thereof.
13 Neither a yield ye your b members
as c instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin: but d yield yourselves unto
God, as those that are alive from
the dead, and your members as instruments of e righteousness unto
God.
14 a For sin shall not have b domin- ion over you: for ye are not under
the law, but under grace.

16 Know ye not, that to whom ye
yield yourselves a servants to obey,
his servants ye are to whom ye
b obey; whether of sin unto death,
or of obedience unto righteousness?
17 But God be thanked, that ye
were the servants of sin, but ye have
a obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you.
18 Being then made a free from b sin, ye became the servants of
righteousness.
19 I speak after the manner of men
because of the infirmity of your
flesh: for as ye have yielded your
members servants to uncleanness
and to iniquity unto iniquity; even
so now yield your members servants
to righteousness unto holiness.
20 For when ye were the servants of
sin, ye were a free from righteousness.
21 What a fruit had ye then in those
things whereof ye are now ashamed?
for the end of those things is death.
22 But now being made a free from
sin, and become servants to God, ye
have your b fruit unto c holiness, and
the end everlasting life.
23 For the a wages of b sin is c death;
but the d gift of God is e eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Chapter 7
The law of Moses is fulfilled in Christ—
Paul delights in the law of God after
the inward man.
Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak
to them that know the law,) how
that the a law hath dominion over
a man as long as he liveth?
2 For the a woman which hath an b husband is bound by the law to her
husband so long as he liveth; but if
the husband be dead, she is loosed
from the law of her husband.
3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man,
she shall be called an adulteress:
but if her husband be dead, she is
free from that law; so that she is no
adulteress, though she be married
to another man.
4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also
are become a dead to the b law by
the body of Christ; that ye should
be married to another, even to him
who is raised from the dead, that
we should bring forth fruit unto
God.
5 a For when we were in the flesh,
the b motions of sins, which were by
the law, did work in our members
to bring forth fruit unto c death.
6 But now we are a delivered from
the law, that being b dead wherein
we were held; that we should serve
in newness of c spirit, and not in the
oldness of the letter.
7 What shall we say then? Is the
law sin? a God forbid. Nay, I had not
known sin, but by the b law: for I had
not known c lust, except the law had
said, Thou shalt not d covet.
8 But sin, taking occasion by the
commandment, wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence. For with- out the a law sin was dead.

9 For I was alive without the law
once: but when the commandment
came, sin revived, and I died.
10 And the commandment, which
was ordained to life, I found to be
unto a death.
11 For sin, a taking occasion by the
commandment, deceived me, and
by it slew me.
12 Wherefore the law is holy, and
the commandment holy, and just,
and good.
13 Was then that which is good
made death unto me? a God forbid.
But sin, that it might appear sin,
working death in me by that which is
good; that sin by the commandment
might become exceeding sinful.
14 For we know that the a law is
spiritual: but I am b carnal, c sold
under sin.
15 a For b that which I do I c allow
not: for what I d would, that do I not;
but what I hate, that do I.
16 If then I do that which I a would
not, I consent unto the law that it
is good.
17 Now then it is no more I that a do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
18 For I know that in me (that is,
in my a flesh,) b dwelleth no good
thing: for to will is present with me;
but how to c perform that which is
good I find not.
19 For the a good that I b would I
do not: but the evil which I would
not, that I do.
20 Now if I do a that I would not, it
is no more I that do it, but sin that
dwelleth in me.
21 I find then a law, that, when
I would do good, evil is a present
with me.
22 For I a delight in the law of God
after the inward man:
23 But I see another law in my
members, a warring against the law
of my mind, and bringing me into
b captivity to the law of sin which
is in my members.
24 O a wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of
this death?
25 I thank God through Jesus Christ
our Lord. So then with the mind I
myself serve the law of God; but
with the flesh the law of sin.
Chapter 8
The law of Christ brings life and peace—
Those adopted as children of God become joint heirs with Christ—God’s elect
are foreordained to eternal life—Christ
makes intercession for man.
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Jesus, who a walk not after the b flesh,
but after the c Spirit.
2 For the law of the Spirit of life
in Christ Jesus hath made me a free
from the law of sin and death.
3 For what the law could not do,
in that it was a weak through the
flesh, God sending his own Son
in the likeness of sinful b flesh,
and for sin, condemned sin in the
flesh:
4 That the righteousness of the
law might be fulfilled in us, who
walk not after the flesh, but after
the a Spirit.

5 For they that are after the flesh
do a mind the things of the flesh; but
they that are after the Spirit the
things of the Spirit.
6 For to be a carnally minded is b death; but to be c spiritually minded
is life and d peace.
7 Because the a carnal mind is b enmity against God: for it is not
subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can be.
8 So then they that are a in the flesh
cannot please God.
9 a But ye are not in the flesh, but
in the Spirit, if so be that the b Spirit
of God c dwell in you. Now if any
man have not the d Spirit of Christ,
he is none of his.
10 And if a Christ be in you, b the
body is dead because of sin; but
the Spirit is life because of c righ- teousness.
11 But if the Spirit of him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
in you, he that raised up Christ from
the dead shall also a quicken your b mortal bodies by his Spirit that
dwelleth in you.
12 Therefore, brethren, we are
debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
13 For if ye live after the flesh,
ye a shall die: but if ye through the
Spirit do b mortify the deeds of the
body, ye shall live.
14 For as many as are a led by the b Spirit of God, they are the c sons
of God.
15 For ye have not received the
spirit of a bondage again to fear; but
ye have received the Spirit of b adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
16 The Spirit itself beareth a witness with our b spirit, that we are
the c children of God:
17 And if children, then heirs; a heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
Christ; if so be that we b suffer with
him, that we may be also glorified
together.
18 For I reckon that the a sufferings
of this present time are not worthy
to be compared with the b glory which
shall be revealed c in us.
19 For the a earnest expectation of
the b creature waiteth for the c manifestation of the sons of God.
20 For the creature was made subject to a vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of him who hath subjected
the same in hope,
21 Because the a creature itself also
shall be b delivered from the bond- age of c corruption into the glorious d liberty of the children of God.
22 For we know that the whole
creation a groaneth and travaileth
in pain together until now.

the Spirit, even we ourselves groan
within ourselves, waiting for the
c adoption, to wit, the redemption
of our body.
24 For we are saved by a hope: but
hope that is b seen is not hope: for
what a man seeth, why doth he yet
hope for?
25 But if we hope for that we see
not, then do we with patience wait
for it.
26 Likewise the Spirit also a helpeth our infirmities: for we know
not what we should b pray for as we
ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
c intercession for us with d groanings
which cannot be uttered.
27 And he that a searcheth the
hearts knoweth what is the mind of
the Spirit, because he maketh b intercession for the saints according
to the will of God.
28 And we know that all things
work together for a good to them
that love God, to them who are the
called according to his purpose.
29 a For whom he did b foreknow,
he also c did predestinate d to be con- formed to the e image of his Son, that
he might be the f firstborn among
many brethren.
30 Moreover whom he a did predestinate, them he also called: and
whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them
he also glorified.
31 What shall we then say to these
things? If God be for us, who can a be
against us?
32 He that spared not his own a Son, but b delivered him up for us
all, how shall he not with him also
freely give us c all things?
33 Who shall a lay any thing to the
charge of God’s elect? It is God that
justifieth.
34 Who is he that condemneth? It
is Christ that died, yea rather, that
is risen again, who is even at the
right hand of God, who also maketh
a intercession for us.
35 Who shall separate us from
the a love of Christ? shall b tribulation, or distress, or c persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?
36 As it is written, For thy sake
we are a killed all the day long; we
are accounted as b sheep for the
slaughter.
37 Nay, in all these things we are a more than b conquerors through
him that loved us.
38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come,
39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall be able to
a separate us from the b love of God,
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

promises, and blessings of the gospel;
yet they are not all Israel who are of
Israel—They must seek their blessings
by faith—The Gentiles also attain to
righteousness and salvation by faith.
I say the truth in Christ, I a lie not,
my b conscience also bearing me
witness in the Holy Ghost,
2 That I have great heaviness and
continual sorrow in my heart.
3 a For I could wish that myself
were b accursed from Christ for my
brethren, my kinsmen according
to the flesh:
4 Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the a adoption, and the glory,
and the b covenants, and the giving
of the law, and the service of God,
and the promises;
5 Whose are the fathers, and of
whom as concerning the a flesh
Christ came, who is over all, God
blessed for ever. Amen.
6 Not as though the word of God a hath taken none effect. For they
are not all Israel, which are of b Israel:
7 a Neither, because they are the
seed of Abraham, are they all chil- dren: but, In b Isaac shall thy seed
be called.
8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the a children of God: but the children
of the promise are counted for
the seed.
9 For this is the word of promise,
At this time will I come, and Sara
shall have a a son.
10 And not only this; but when
a Rebecca also had conceived by one,
even by our father Isaac;
11 (For the children being not yet
born, neither having done any good
or evil, that the purpose of God according to a election might stand, not
of works, but of him that calleth;)
12 It was said unto her, The a elder
shall serve the younger.
13 As it is written, Jacob have I a loved, but Esau have I hated.
14 What shall we say then? Is there a unrighteousness with God? b God
forbid.
15 For he saith to Moses, I will have
mercy on whom I will have mercy,
and I will have a compassion on
whom I will have compassion.
16 So then it is not of him that will- eth, nor of him that runneth, but of
God that sheweth a mercy.
17 For the scripture saith unto
Pharaoh, Even for this same a purpose have I raised thee up, that I
might shew my power in thee, and
that my name might be declared
throughout all the earth.
18 Therefore hath he a mercy on
whom he will have mercy, and whom
he will he b hardeneth.
19 Thou wilt say then unto me,
Why doth he yet find fault? For
who hath resisted his will?
20 Nay but, O man, who art thou
that a repliest against God? Shall the
thing formed say to him that formed
it, Why hast thou b made me thus?
21 Hath not the a potter power over
the clay, of the same lump to make
one vessel unto honour, and another
unto dishonour?

known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted
to a destruction:
23 And that he might make known
the a riches of his b glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore
prepared unto glory,
24 Even us, whom he hath called,
not of the Jews only, but also of the
Gentiles?
25 As he saith also in a Osee, I will
call them my people, which were
not my b people; and her beloved,
which was not beloved.
26 And it shall come to pass, that
in the place where it was said unto
them, Ye are not my people; there
shall they be called the a children
of the living God.
27 a Esaias also crieth concerning
Israel, Though the b number of the
children of c Israel be as the sand of
the sea, a d remnant shall be saved:
28 For he will finish the work,
and cut it short in a righteousness:
because a short work will the Lord
make upon the earth.
29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of a Sabaoth had left
us a b seed, we had been as Sodoma,
and been made like unto Gomorrha.
30 What shall we say then? That
the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to
righteousness, even the a righteous- ness which is of faith.
31 But a Israel, which followed after
the law of righteousness, hath not
attained to the law of righteousness.
32 a Wherefore? Because they sought
it not by faith, but as it were by the
works of the law. For they b stumbled
at that stumblingstone;
33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in
Sion a a stumblingstone and b rock of c offence: and whosoever believeth
on him shall not be ashamed.
Chapter 10
Salvation comes through righteousness
to those who believe in Christ—Faith
comes by hearing the gospel taught by
legal administrators sent of God.
Brethren, my heart’s desire and
prayer to God for Israel is, that they
might be a saved.
2 For I bear them record that they
have a a zeal of God, but not accord- ing to knowledge.
3 For they being ignorant of God’s a righteousness, and b going about to
establish their own righteousness,
have not c submitted themselves
unto the righteousness of God.
4 For Christ is the a end of the law
for righteousness to every one that
believeth.
5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That
the man which doeth those things
shall live by them.
6 But the a righteousness which is
of faith speaketh on this wise, Say
not in thine heart, Who shall ascend
into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ
down from above:)
7 Or, Who shall descend into the
deep? (that is, to bring up Christ
again from the dead.)

thy heart: that is, the word of faith,
which we preach;
9 That if thou shalt confess with
thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath
raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved.
10 For with the a heart man b believeth unto righteousness; and with
the mouth confession is made unto
c salvation.
11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not
be ashamed.
12 For there is no a difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
the same Lord over all is b rich unto
all that c call upon him.
13 For whosoever shall a call upon
the name of the Lord shall be saved.
14 How then shall they call on him
in whom they have not a believed?
and how shall they believe in him
of whom they have not heard?
and how shall they hear without a
b preacher?
15 And how shall they a preach, except they be b sent? as it is written,
How beautiful are the c feet of them
that preach the d gospel of e peace, and
bring glad tidings of good things!
16 But they have not all a obeyed
the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord,
who hath b believed our report?
17 So then a faith cometh by b hear- ing, and hearing by the word of God.
18 But I say, Have they not heard?
Yes verily, their sound went into all
the earth, and their a words unto the
ends of the b world.
19 But I say, Did not Israel know?
First Moses saith, I will provoke you
to a jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will
anger you.
20 But a Esaias is very bold, and
saith, I was found of them that
b sought me not; I was made manifest
unto them that asked not after me.
21 But to Israel he saith, All day
long I have stretched forth my hands
unto a a disobedient and b gainsaying people.
Chapter 11
Israel was chosen (foreordained) accord- ing to the election of grace—But some
harden their hearts against it—The
Gentiles are adopted into the house of
Israel—The gospel goes preferentially
to the Gentiles until the fulness of the
Gentiles.
I say then, Hath God cast away his
people? a God forbid. For I also am
an b Israelite, of the seed of Abraham,
of the tribe of Benjamin.
2 God hath not cast away his a peo- ple which he b foreknew. c Wot ye not
what the scripture saith of d Elias?
how he maketh intercession to God
against Israel, saying,
3 Lord, they have a killed thy proph- ets, and digged down thine altars;
and I am b left alone, and they seek
my life.
4 But what saith the answer of God
unto him? I have a reserved to myself
seven thousand men, who have not
bowed the knee to the image of Baal.

5 Even so then at this present time
also there is a remnant according
to the a election of grace.
6 And if by a grace, then is it no
more of b works: otherwise grace is
no more grace. But if it be of works,
then is it no more grace: otherwise
work is no more work.
7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
but the election hath obtained it,
and the rest a were blinded
8 (According as it is written, God
hath given them the spirit of a slumber, eyes that they should not see,
and ears that they should not b hear;)
unto this day.
9 And David saith, Let their table
be made a a snare, and a trap, and a
stumblingblock, and a b recompence
unto them:
10 Let their eyes be darkened, that
they may not see, and bow down
their back alway.
11 I say then, Have they stumbled
that they should fall? a God forbid:
but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for
to provoke them to b jealousy.
12 Now if the fall of them be the
riches of the world, and the a diminishing of them the riches of
the Gentiles; how much more their
fulness?
13 For I speak to you a Gentiles, in- asmuch as I am the apostle of the
Gentiles, I b magnify mine office:
14 If by any means I may provoke
to emulation them which are my flesh,
and might save some of them.
15 For if the casting away of them
be the a reconciling of the world,
what shall the receiving of them be,
but life from the dead?
16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the
lump is also holy: and if the a root be
holy, so are the branches.
17 And if some of the branches be
broken off, and thou, being a wild
olive a tree, wert grafted in among
them, and with them partakest of
the root and fatness of the olive tree;
18 a Boast not against the branches.
But if thou boast, thou bearest not
the root, but the root thee.
19 Thou wilt say then, The branches
were broken off, that I might be
grafted in.
20 Well; because of a unbelief they
were b broken off, and thou stand- est by c faith. Be not highminded,
but d fear:
21 For if God spared not the a natu- ral branches, take heed lest he also b spare not thee.
22 Behold therefore the goodness
and severity of God: on them which
fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be
cut off.
23 And they also, if they abide not
still in unbelief, shall be grafted in:
for God is able to graft them in again.
24 For if thou wert cut out of the
olive tree which is wild by nature,
and wert grafted contrary to nature
into a good olive tree: how much
more shall these, which be the natu- ral branches, be grafted into their
own olive tree?
25 For I would not, brethren, that
ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your
own a conceits; that b blindness in
part is happened to Israel, until
the c fulness of the d Gentiles be
come in.

26 And so all a Israel shall be saved:

out of b Sion the c Deliverer, and
shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob:
27 For this is my a covenant unto
them, when I shall take away their

28 As concerning the gospel, they
are enemies for your sakes: but as
touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.
29 For the gifts and calling of God
are without repentance.
30 For as ye in times past a have
not believed God, yet have now
obtained mercy through their
b unbelief:
31 Even so have these also now not a believed, that through your mercy
they also may obtain mercy.
32 For God hath a concluded them
all in unbelief, that he might have
mercy upon all.
33 O the depth of the a riches both
of the b wisdom and c knowledge
of God! how d unsearchable are his
judgments, and his ways past e finding out!
34 For who hath known the a mind

35 Or who hath first given to him,
and it shall be recompensed unto
him again?
36 For of him, and a through him,
and to him, are all things: to whom
be glory for ever. Amen.
Chapter 12
Paul counsels the Saints to present
their bodies as a living sacrifice, to use
their own grace-given gifts, and to live
as Saints should live.
I beseech you therefore, brethren,
by the mercies of God, that ye present your a bodies a living b sacrifice,
holy, c acceptable unto God, which is
your reasonable d service.
2 And be not conformed to this a world: but be ye b transformed by
the c renewing of your d mind, that
ye may e prove what is that good,
and acceptable, and perfect, f will
of God.
3 For I say, through the grace given
unto me, to every man that is among
you, not to a think of himself more
highly than he ought to think; but
to think b soberly, according as c God
hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
4 For as we have many members
in one body, and all members have
not the same a office:
5 So we, being many, are a one b body
in Christ, and every one members
one of another.
6 Having then gifts differing according to the a grace that is given to
us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy
according to the proportion of b faith;

ministering: or he that teacheth,

9 Let love be a without dissimulation. Abhor that which is b evil;

18 If it be possible, as much as lieth

19 Dearly beloved, a avenge not
yourselves, but rather give place
unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith
the Lord.
20 Therefore if thine a enemy hun- ger, feed him; if he thirst, give him
drink: for in so doing thou shalt
heap coals of fire on his head.
21 Be not overcome of evil, but a overcome evil with good.
Chapter 13
Paul counsels, Be subject unto God’s
ministers; keep the commandments;
love one another; righteousness leads
to salvation.
Let every soul a be subject unto
the higher b powers. For there is no c power d but of God: the e powers that
be are ordained of God.
2 Whosoever therefore resisteth
the power, resisteth the ordinance
of God: and they that a resist shall
receive to themselves b damnation.
3 For rulers are not a terror to good
works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then
not be afraid of the a power? do that
which is b good, and thou shalt have
praise of the same:
4 For he is a the minister of God
to thee for good. But if thou do
that which is evil, be afraid; for
he beareth not the sword in vain:
for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him
that doeth evil.
5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for
a conscience sake.
6 a For for this cause pay ye tribute
also: for they are God’s ministers,
attending continually upon this
very thing.

7 Render therefore to all their dues:
tribute to whom tribute is due; cus- tom to whom custom; fear to whom
fear; a honour to whom honour.
8 a Owe no man any thing, but to
love one another: for he that b loveth
another hath fulfilled the law.
9 For this, Thou shalt not commit a adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou
shalt not b steal, Thou shalt not bear
false witness, Thou shalt not c covet;
and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in
this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
thy d neighbour as thyself.
10 a Love worketh no ill to his neigh- bour: therefore love is the fulfilling
of the b law.
11 And that, knowing the time,
that now it is high a time to awake
out of b sleep: for now is our salva- tion nearer than when we believed.
12 The night is far spent, the a day
is at hand: let us therefore cast off
the works of b darkness, and let us
put on the c armour of d light.
13 Let us walk a honestly, as in the
day; not in b rioting and c drunk- enness, not in d chambering and
wantonness, not in strife and
e envying.
14 But a put ye on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and make not provision for
the flesh, to fulfil the b lusts thereof.
Chapter 14
Avoid quarreling about opinions and
making unrighteous judgment of each
other—Every knee will bow to Christ—
The kingdom of God embraces righ- teousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost.
Him that is a weak in the faith receive
ye, but not to b doubtful c disputations.
2 For one believeth that he may
eat all things: another, who is weak,
eateth a herbs.
3 Let not him that eateth despise
him that eateth not; and let not him
which eateth not a judge him that
eateth: for God hath received him.
4 Who art thou that a judgest another man’s servant? to his own
master he standeth or falleth. Yea,
he shall be holden up: for God is
able to make him stand.
5 One man esteemeth one a day
above another: another esteemeth
every day alike. Let every man be
fully persuaded in his own mind.
6 He that regardeth the day, re- gardeth it unto the Lord; and he
that regardeth not the day, to the
Lord he doth not regard it. He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth
not, to the Lord he eateth not, and
giveth God thanks.
7 For none of us a liveth to himself,
and no man dieth to himself.
8 For whether we live, we live unto
the Lord; and whether we die, we
a die unto the Lord: whether we live
therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
9 For to this end Christ both died,
and rose, and revived, that he might

be a Lord both of the b dead and
living.
10 But why dost thou a judge thy
brother? or why dost thou set at
nought thy brother? for we shall
all stand before the b judgment seat
of Christ.
11 For it is written, As I live, saith
the Lord, every a knee shall bow to
me, and every tongue shall b confess to God.
12 So then every one of us shall
give account of himself to God.
13 Let us not therefore judge one
another any more: but judge this
rather, that no man put a a stum- blingblock or an occasion to fall in
his brother’s way.
14 I know, and am persuaded by
the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing a unclean of itself: but to him that
b esteemeth any thing to be unclean,
to him it is unclean.
15 But if thy brother be grieved
with thy meat, a now walkest thou not b charitably. Destroy not him c with
thy meat, for whom Christ died.
16 Let not then your good be evil
spoken of:
17 For the kingdom of God is not a meat and drink; but b righteousness, and c peace, and d joy in the
Holy Ghost.
18 For he that in these things
serveth Christ is acceptable to God,
and approved of men.
19 Let us therefore follow after the
things which make for a peace, and
things wherewith one may b edify
another.
20 a For meat destroy not the b work
of God. All things indeed are pure;
but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
21 It is good neither to eat flesh,
nor to drink wine, nor any thing
whereby thy brother stumbleth, or
is a offended, or is made weak.
22 Hast thou faith? have it to thy- self before God. Happy is he that
condemneth not himself a in that
thing which he alloweth.
23 And he that a doubteth is
damned if he eat, because he eateth
not of faith: for whatsoever is not
of b faith is c sin.
Chapter 15
True Saints fellowship one another—
Paul recounts his diligence in preaching

We then that are strong ought to a bear the infirmities of the b weak,
and not to please ourselves.
2 Let every one of us please his a neighbour for his good to b edifi- cation.
3 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The a re- proaches of them that reproached
thee fell on me.

d patience and comfort of the e scriptures might have f hope.
5 Now the God of patience and a consolation grant you to be b likeminded one toward another accord- ing to Christ Jesus:
6 That ye may with one mind and
one mouth glorify God, even the
a Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to
the glory of God.
8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was
a minister of the a circumcision for
the truth of God, to b confirm the c promises made unto the fathers:
9 And that the Gentiles might glo- rify God for his a mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will b confess to
thee among the c Gentiles, and sing
unto thy name.
10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye a Gentiles, with his people.
11 And again, Praise the Lord, all
ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye
people.
12 And again, a Esaias saith, There
shall be a root of b Jesse, and he that
shall rise to reign over the Gentiles;
in him shall the Gentiles trust.
13 Now the God of hope fill you
with all joy and a peace in believing, that ye may abound in b hope,
through the power of the Holy
Ghost.
14 And I myself also am persuaded
of you, my brethren, that ye also
are full of goodness, filled with all
a knowledge, able also to b admonish
one another.
15 Nevertheless, brethren, I have
written the more boldly unto you in
a some sort, as putting you in mind,
because of the b grace that is given
to me of God,
16 That I should be the a minister
of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, min- istering the gospel of God, that the
b offering up of the Gentiles might
be acceptable, being c sanctified by
the Holy Ghost.
17 I have therefore whereof I may a glory through Jesus Christ in those
things which pertain to God.
18 For I will not dare to speak of
any of those things which Christ
hath not wrought by me, to make
the Gentiles obedient, by word and
deed,
19 Through mighty a signs and wonders, by the power of the b Spirit of
God; so that from Jerusalem, and
round about unto Illyricum, I have
fully preached the gospel of Christ.
20 Yea, so have I strived to preach
the gospel, not where Christ was
named, lest I should build upon
another man’s a foundation:
21 But as it is written, To whom he
was not a spoken of, they shall see:
and they that have not heard shall
understand.
22 For which cause also I have been
much a hindered from coming to you.
23 But now having no more a place
in these parts, and having a great
desire these many years to come
unto you;
24 Whensoever I take my journey
into Spain, I will come to you: for I
trust to see you in my journey, and
to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat
filled with your company.

25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to
minister unto the saints.
26 For it hath pleased them of
Macedonia and Achaia to make a
certain a contribution for the poor
saints which are at Jerusalem.
27 It hath pleased them verily; and
their debtors they are. For if the
Gentiles have been made partakers of their a spiritual things, their b duty is also to minister unto them
in c carnal things.
28 When therefore I have performed
this, and have sealed to them this
a fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
29 And I am sure that, when I
come unto you, I shall come in the

for the love of the Spirit, that ye
strive together with me in your

them that a do not believe in Judæa;
and that my service which I have
for Jerusalem may be accepted of
the saints;
32 That I may come unto you with
joy by the will of God, and may with
you be a refreshed.
33 Now the God of peace be with
you all. Amen.
Chapter 16
Paul sends greetings to various Saints—
He counsels the Saints to avoid those
who cause divisions—The Saints should
be wise concerning good and innocent
concerning evil.
I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church
which is at Cenchrea:
2 That ye receive her in the Lord,
as becometh saints, and that ye assist
her in whatsoever business she hath
need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.
3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my
helpers in Christ Jesus:
4 Who have for my life laid down
their own necks: unto whom not
only I give thanks, but also all the
churches of the Gentiles.
5 Likewise greet the church that
is in their house. Salute my well- beloved Epænetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.
6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much
labour on us.
7 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my
kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners,
who are of note among the apostles,
who also were in Christ before me.
8 Greet Amplias my beloved in
the Lord.
9 Salute Urbane, our helper in
Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
10 Salute Apelles approved in
Christ. Salute them which are of
Aristobulus’ a household.
11 Salute Herodion my kinsman.
Greet them that be of the a household
of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa,
who labour in the Lord. Salute the
beloved Persis, which laboured
much in the Lord.
13 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord,
and his mother and mine.
14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon,
Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
brethren which are with them.
15 Salute Philologus, and Julia,
Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are
with them.
16 Salute one another with an
holy a kiss. The b churches of Christ
salute you.

The First Epistle of
Paul the Apostle to the
Corinthians
Chapter 1
True Saints are perfectly united in the
same mind and in the same judgment—
Preach the gospel and save souls—The
gospel is preached by the weak and the
simple.
Paul, called to be an apostle of
Jesus Christ through the will of
God, and Sosthenes our brother,
2 Unto the church of God which is
at Corinth, to them that are a sanc­ tified in Christ Jesus, called to be b saints, with all that in every place 
1439 1 Corinthians 1:3–24
call upon the name of Jesus Christ
our Lord, both theirs and ours:
3 Grace be unto you, and a peace,
from God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I thank my God always on your
behalf, for the grace of God which
is given you by Jesus Christ;
5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and
in all knowledge;
6 Even as the a testimony of Christ
was b confirmed in you:
7 So that ye a come behind in no
gift; waiting for the b coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ:
8 Who shall also a confirm you unto
the end, that ye may be b blameless
in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 God is faithful, by whom ye were
called unto the a fellowship of his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye all speak the same thing, and
that there be no a divisions among
you; but that ye be perfectly joined
together in the same b mind and in
the same judgment.
11 For it hath been declared unto
me a of you, my brethren, by them
which are of the house of Chloe, that
there are b contentions among you.
12 Now this I say, that every one
of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of
Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I
of a Christ.
13 Is Christ a divided? was Paul
crucified for you? or were ye bap- tized in the name of Paul?
14 I thank God that I baptized none
of you, a but b Crispus and Gaius;
15 Lest any should say that I had
baptized in mine own name.
16 And I baptized also the household of a Stephanas: besides, I
know not whether I baptized any
other.
17 For Christ sent me not to bap- tize, but to preach the gospel: not
with a wisdom of words, lest the
cross of Christ should be made of
none effect.
18 For the a preaching of the cross
is to them that perish foolishness;
but unto us which are saved it is
the b power of God.
19 For it is written, I will destroy
the wisdom of the wise, and will
bring to nothing the a understanding of the b prudent.
20 Where is the wise? where is
the a scribe? where is the b disputer
of this c world? hath not God made
foolish the d wisdom of this e world?
21 For after that in the wisdom of
God the world a by wisdom knew
not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of b preaching to save them
that believe.
22 For the Jews require a a sign,
and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
23 But we a preach Christ b crucified,
unto the Jews a c stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness;

called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
the b power of God, and the c wisdom
of God.
25 Because the a foolishness of God
is wiser than men; and the weakness
of God is stronger than men.
26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
after the a flesh, not many mighty,
not many noble, are b called:
27 But God hath chosen the a fool- ish things of the world to b confound
the wise; and God hath chosen the
c weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
28 And base things of the world,
and things which are despised, hath
God chosen, yea, and things which
are not, to bring to nought things
that are:
29 That no flesh should glory in
his presence.
30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,
who of God is made unto us wisdom,
and righteousness, and a sanctification, and redemption:
31 That, according as it is written,
He that glorieth, let him a glory in
the Lord.
Chapter 2
The gospel is preached by the power of
the Spirit—The Spirit reveals all things
to the Saints—The unrepentant natural
man cannot receive the things of the
Spirit of God.
And I, brethren, when I came to you,
came not with excellency of speech
or of wisdom, declaring unto you
the a testimony of God.
2 For I determined not to know
any thing among you, a save Jesus
Christ, and him b crucified.
3 And I was with you in a weakness,
and in fear, and in much trembling.
4 And my a speech and my preaching was not with b enticing words of
man’s wisdom, but in demonstration
of the c Spirit and of d power:
5 That your faith should not stand
in the wisdom of men, but in the
a power of God.
6 Howbeit we speak wisdom
among them that are a perfect: yet
not the wisdom of this world, nor
of the princes of this world, that
come to nought:
7 But we speak the a wisdom of God
in a b mystery, even the hidden c wis- dom, which God d ordained before
the world unto our glory:
8 Which none of the princes of this
world knew: for had they known it,
they would not have a crucified the
Lord of glory.
9 But as it is written, a Eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the
things which God hath b prepared
for them that love him.
10 But God hath a revealed them
unto us by his b Spirit: for the c Spirit d searcheth all things, yea, the deep
things of God.

things of a man, save the spirit of
man which is in him? even so the

which is of God; that we might know
the things that are freely given to
us of God.
13 Which things also we speak,
not in the words which man’s a wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy
Ghost b teacheth; comparing spiri- tual things with spiritual.
14 But the a natural man b receiveth
not the things of the c Spirit of God:
for they are d foolishness unto him:
neither can he e know them, because
they are f spiritually g discerned.
15 But he that is spiritual a judgeth
all things, yet he himself is judged
of no man.
16 For who hath known the mind of
the Lord, that he may a instruct him?
But we have the b mind of Christ.
Chapter 3
Milk comes before meat in the Church—
Men’s works will be tried by fire—The
Saints are the temple of God, and if
they are faithful, they will inherit all
things.
And I, brethren, could not speak unto
you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
2 I have fed you with a milk, and
not with meat: for hitherto ye were
not able to bear it, neither yet now
are ye able.
3 For ye are yet a carnal: for whereas
there is among you b envying, and c strife, and d divisions, are ye not
carnal, and walk as men?
4 For while one saith, I am of Paul;
and another, I am of Apollos; are ye
not carnal?
5 Who then is Paul, and who is
Apollos, but a ministers by whom
ye believed, even as the Lord gave
to every man?
6 I have a planted, Apollos watered;
but God b gave the c increase.
7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
watereth; but God that giveth the
increase.
8 Now he that planteth and he
that watereth are one: and every
man shall receive his own a reward
according to his own labour.
9 For we are a labourers together
with God: ye are God’s b husbandry,
ye are God’s building.
10 According to the a grace of God
which is given unto me, as a wise
masterbuilder, I have laid the
foundation, and another buildeth
thereon. But let every man take
heed how he buildeth thereupon.
11 For other a foundation can no
man lay than that is laid, which is
Jesus Christ.
12 Now if any man build upon this
foundation gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble;

declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the a fire shall b try
every man’s work of what sort it is.
14 If any man’s work abide which
he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward.
15 If any man’s work shall be
burned, he shall suffer loss: but
he himself a shall be saved; yet so
as by fire.
16 Know ye not that ye are the a temple of God, and that the b Spirit
of God dwelleth c in you?
17 If any man a defile the temple
of God, him shall God destroy; for
the temple of God is b holy, which
temple ye are.
18 Let no man deceive himself. If
any man among you a seemeth to be
wise in this world, let him become
a b fool, that he may be c wise.
19 For the a wisdom of this b world
is c foolishness with God. For it is
written, He taketh the wise in their
own d craftiness.
20 And again, The Lord a knoweth
the thoughts of the wise, that they
are b vain.
21 Therefore let no man a glory in
men. For all things are yours;
22 Whether a Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas, or the world, or life, or
death, or things present, or things
to come; b all are yours;
23 And ye are a Christ’s; and Christ
is God’s.
Chapter 4
Christ’s ministers must be faithful—The
Apostles suffer, minister, and keep the
faith—The kingdom of God is not in
word but in power.
Let a man so account of us, as of the
ministers of Christ, and stewards of
the a mysteries of God.
2 Moreover it is required in a stewards, that a man be found b faithful.
3 But with me it is a very small
thing that I should be judged of
you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I
judge not mine own self.
4 For I know nothing a by myself;
yet am I not hereby justified: but he
that b judgeth me is the Lord.
5 Therefore judge nothing before
the time, until the Lord come, who
both will bring to light the a hidden
things of darkness, and will make
b manifest the counsels of the hearts:
and then shall every man have
praise of God.
6 And these things, brethren, I have
in a figure transferred to myself
and to Apollos for your sakes; that
ye might learn in us not to think
of men above that which is written,
that no one of you be a puffed up
for one against another.
7 For who maketh thee a to differ
from another? and what hast thou
that thou didst not b receive? now
if thou didst receive it, why dost
thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich,
ye have reigned as kings without
us: and I would to God ye did reign,
that we also might reign with you.

9 For I think that God hath set forth
us the a apostles last, as it were b appointed to death: for we are made
a spectacle unto the world, and to
angels, and to men.
10 We are fools for Christ’s sake, but
ye are wise in Christ; we are weak,
but ye are strong; ye are honourable,
but we are despised.
11 Even unto this present hour
we both hunger, and thirst, and are
naked, and are a buffeted, and have
no certain dwellingplace;
12 And a labour, working with our b own c hands: being d reviled, we
bless; being e persecuted, we f suffer
it:
13 Being defamed, we entreat: we
are made as the filth of the world,
and are the offscouring of all things
unto this day.
14 I write not these things to a shame you, but as my beloved b sons
I c warn you.
15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have
ye not many fathers: for in Christ
Jesus I have begotten you through
the a gospel.
16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye a followers of me.
17 For this cause have I sent unto
you a Timotheus, who is my beloved
son, and faithful in the Lord, who
shall bring you into remembrance
of my ways which be in Christ, as I
teach every where in every church.
18 Now some are a puffed up, as
though I would not come to you.
19 But I will come to you shortly,
if the Lord will, and will know, not
the speech of them which are puffed
up, but the power.
20 For the kingdom of God is not
in word, but in a power.
21 a What will ye? shall I come unto
you with a rod, or in love, and in
the spirit of b meekness?
Chapter 5
The Church cannot fellowship sinners
—Christ, our passover, was sacrificed
for us.
It is reported commonly that there
is a fornication among you, and
such fornication as is not so much
as named among the Gentiles, that
one should have his father’s wife.
2 And ye are a puffed up, and have
not rather mourned, that he that
hath done this deed might be taken
away from among you.
3 For I verily, a as absent in body,
but present in spirit, have judged
already, as though I were present,

not with old b leaven, neither with
the leaven of malice and wicked- ness; but with the unleavened bread
of c sincerity and truth.
9 I wrote unto you in an a epistle
not to b company with c fornicators:
10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the
a covetous, or b extortioners, or with
idolaters; for then must ye needs go
out of the world.
11 But now I have written unto you
not to keep a company, if any man
that is called a brother be a fornicator,
or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer,
or a b drunkard, or an extortioner; with
such an one c no not to d eat.
12 For what have I to do to judge
them also that are a without? do not
ye b judge them that are within?
13 But them that are without God
judgeth. Therefore put away from
among yourselves that wicked person.
Chapter 6
Church members should not fight one
another in the courts—The unrighteous
will not be saved—True Saints are the
temple of the Holy Ghost.
Dare any of you, having a a matter
against another, go to b law before
the unjust, and not before the saints?
2 Do ye not know that the saints
shall a judge the b world? and if the
world shall be judged by you, are
ye unworthy to judge the smallest
matters?
3 Know ye not that we shall judge
angels? how much more things that
pertain to this life?
4 If then ye have judgments of
things pertaining to this life, set
them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
5 I speak to your a shame. Is it so,
that there is not a wise man among
you? no, not one that shall be able
to judge between his brethren?
6 But brother goeth to law with
brother, and that before the unbe- lievers.
7 Now therefore there is utterly
a fault among you, because ye go
to law one with another. Why do
ye not rather take a wrong? why
do ye not rather b suffer yourselves to
be c defrauded?
8 Nay, ye do wrong, and a defraud,
and that your brethren.
9 Know ye not that the a unrigh- teous shall not b inherit the kingdom
of God? Be not deceived: neither
c fornicators, nor idolaters, nor d adulterers, nor e effeminate, nor f abusers
of themselves with mankind,
10 Nor a thieves, nor covetous, nor b drunkards, nor c revilers, nor d ex- tortioners, shall inherit the king- dom of God.
11 And such were some of you: but

12 a All things are lawful unto me,
but all things are not b expedient:
all things are lawful for me, but
I will not be brought under the
power of any.
13 Meats for the belly, and the belly
for meats: but God shall destroy both
it and them. Now the body is not for a fornication, but for the Lord; and
the Lord for the body.
14 And God hath both raised up
the Lord, and will also a raise up us
by his own power.
15 Know ye not that your bodies
are the a members of Christ? shall
I then take the members of Christ,
and make them the members of an
harlot? God forbid.
16 What? know ye not that he
which is joined to an harlot is one
body ? for two, saith he, shall be
a one flesh.
17 But he that is joined unto the
Lord is a one spirit.
18 Flee fornication. Every sin that
a man doeth is without the body;
but he that committeth fornication
sinneth against his own body.
19 What? know ye not that your a body is the b temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you, which ye
have of God, and ye are not your
c own?
20 For ye are a bought with a price:
therefore glorify God in your body,
and in your spirit, which are God’s.
Chapter 7
Paul answers special questions about
marriage among those called on mis- sions—Paul praises self-discipline.
Now concerning the things whereof
ye wrote unto me: a It is good for a
man not to touch a woman.
2 Nevertheless, a to avoid b fornication, let every man have his own
c wife, and let every woman have
her own husband.
3 Let the a husband render unto the b wife due c benevolence: and likewise
also the wife unto the husband.
4 The wife hath not power of her
own body, but the husband: and
likewise also the husband hath
not power of his own body, but the
wife.
5 a Defraud ye not one the other,
except it be with consent for a time,
that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together
again, that b Satan c tempt you not
for your incontinency.
6 But I speak this by permission,
and not of commandment.
7 For I would that all men were
even as I myself. But every man hath
his a proper b gift of God, one after
this manner, and another after that.
8 I say therefore to the unmarried
and a widows, It is good for them if
they abide even as I.
9 a But if they cannot b contain, let
them marry: for it is better to marry
than to c burn.

1 Corinthians 7:10–31 1446
10 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let
not the a wife b depart from her
husband:
11 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be a reconciled
to her husband: and let not the hus- band b put away his wife.
12 But to the rest speak I, not the
Lord: If any brother hath a wife that
believeth not, and she be pleased
to dwell with him, let him not put
her away.
13 And the woman which hath an a husband that believeth not, and if
he be pleased to dwell with her, let
her not leave him.
14 a For the unbelieving b husband
is c sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is d sanctified by
the husband: else were your chil- dren unclean; but now are they holy.
15 But if the unbelieving depart,
let him depart. A brother or a sister
is not under bondage in such cases:
but God hath called us a to peace.
16 For what knowest thou, O wife,
whether thou shalt a save thy hus- band? or how knowest thou, O man,
whether thou shalt save thy wife?
17 But as a God hath distributed to
every man, as the Lord hath called
every one, so let him walk. And so
b ordain I in all churches.
18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not a become
uncircumcised. Is any called in
uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcised.
19 a Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing, but the
keeping of the commandments of
God.
20 Let every man abide in the same
calling wherein he was called.
21 Art thou called being a servant?
care not for it: but if thou mayest
be made free, use it rather.
22 For he that is called in the Lord,
being a servant, is the Lord’s a freeman: likewise also he that is called,
being free, is Christ’s b servant.
23 Ye are a bought with a price; be
not ye the b servants of men.
24 Brethren, let every man, wherein
he is called, therein abide with
God.
25 Now concerning virgins I have
no commandment of the Lord: yet
I give my judgment, as one that
hath obtained a mercy of the Lord
to be faithful.
26 I suppose therefore that this
is good for the present a distress,
I say, that it is good for a man so
to be.
27 Art thou bound unto a wife?
seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed
from a wife? seek not a wife.
28 But and if thou marry, thou hast
not sinned; and if a virgin marry,
she hath not sinned. Nevertheless
such shall have trouble in the flesh:
but I spare you.
29 a But this I say, brethren, the
time is short: it remaineth, that both
they that have wives be as though
they had none;
30 And they that weep, as though
they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not;
and they that buy, as though they
possessed not;
31 And they that use this world,
as not abusing it: for the a fashion of
this b world passeth away.

32 But I would have you without a carefulness. He that is unmarried
careth for the things that belong
to the Lord, how he may please
the Lord:
33 But he that is married careth
for the things that are of the world,
how he may please his wife.
34 There is difference also between
a wife and a virgin. The unmarried
woman careth for the things of the
Lord, that she may be holy both
in body and in spirit: but she that
is married careth for the things of
the world, how she may please her
husband.
35 And this I speak for your own
profit; not that I may cast a snare
upon you, but for that which is
comely, and that ye may attend
upon the Lord without distraction.
36 But if any man think that he
behaveth himself uncomely toward
his virgin, if she pass the flower of
her age, and need so require, let him
do what he will, he sinneth not: let
them marry.
37 Nevertheless he that standeth
steadfast in his heart, having no
necessity, but hath power over his
own will, and hath so decreed in his
heart that he will keep his virgin,
doeth well.
38 a So then he that giveth her in
marriage doeth well; but he that
giveth her not in marriage doeth
better.
39 The a wife is bound by the b law
as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband be dead, she is at
liberty to be married to whom she
will; only in the Lord.
40 But she is happier if she so abide,
after my judgment: and I think also
that I have the Spirit of God.
Chapter 8
There are many gods and many lords—
To us there is one God (the Father) and
one Lord, who is Christ.
Now a as touching things offered
unto b idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth
up, but c charity d edifieth.
2 And if any man think that he
knoweth any thing, he knoweth
nothing yet as he ought to a know.
3 But if any man love God, the
same is a known of him.
4 As concerning therefore the eating of those things a that are offered
in sacrifice unto b idols, we know that
an c idol is nothing in the world, and
that there is none other God but one.
5 For though there be that are
called gods, whether in heaven or
in earth, (as there be gods many,
and lords many,)
6 But to us there is but one a God,
the b Father, of whom are all things,
and we in him; and one c Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom are d all things, and
we by him.
7 Howbeit there is not in every man
that knowledge: for some with con- science of the idol unto this hour
eat it as a thing offered unto an idol;
and their a conscience being weak
is defiled.
8 But a meat commendeth us not to
God: for neither, if we eat, are we
the better; neither, if we eat not, are
we the worse.
9 But take heed lest by any means
this a liberty of yours become a

he that giveth himself in

10 For if any man see thee which
hast knowledge sit at meat in the
idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be
emboldened to eat those things
which are offered to idols;
11 And through thy knowledge
shall the weak brother perish, for
whom Christ died?
12 But when ye sin so against the a brethren, and wound their weak
conscience, ye sin against Christ.
13 Wherefore, if meat a make my

flesh while the world standeth, lest
I make my brother to offend.
Chapter 9
Paul rejoices in his Christian liberty—
He preaches the gospel to all without
charge—He is all things to all men to
gain converts.
Am I not an a apostle? am I not free?
have I not b seen Jesus Christ our
Lord? are not ye my c work in the
Lord?
2 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for
the a seal of mine apostleship are ye
in the Lord.
3 Mine a answer to them that do b examine me is this,
4 Have we not power to eat and
to drink?
5 Have we not power to lead about
a sister, a a wife, as well as other
apostles, and as the b brethren of
the Lord, and Cephas?
6 Or I only and Barnabas, have
not we power to forbear working?
7 Who goeth a a warfare any time
at his own charges? who planteth
a b vineyard, and c eateth not of the
fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock,
and eateth not of the milk of the
flock?
8 Say I these things as a man? or
saith not the law the same also?
9 For it is written in the law of
Moses, Thou shalt not a muzzle the
mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
10 Or saith he it altogether for our
sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this
is a written: that he that ploweth
should plow in hope; and that he
that thresheth in hope should be
b partaker of his hope.
11 If we have sown unto you a spiri- tual things, is it a great thing if we
shall reap your carnal things?
12 If others be partakers of this
power over you, are not we rather?
Nevertheless we have not used this
a power; but suffer all things, lest
we should hinder the gospel of
Christ.
13 Do ye not know that they which a minister about holy things b live of
the things of the temple? and they
which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
14 Even so hath the Lord ordained
that they which a preach the b gospel
should c live of the gospel.
15 But I have used none of these
things: neither have I written these
things, that it should be so done
unto me: for it were better for me
to die, than that any man should
make my glorying void.
16 For though I preach the a gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for

b necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is
unto me, if I c preach not the gospel!
17 For if I do this thing a willingly,
I have a b reward: but if against my
will, a c dispensation of the gospel is
committed unto me.
18 What is my reward then? Verily
that, when I preach the gospel, I may
make the gospel of Christ without
a charge, that I abuse not my power
in the gospel.
19 For though I be free from all
men, yet have I made myself a servant unto all, that I might gain the
more.
20 And unto the Jews I became as
a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to
them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them
that are under the law;
21 To them that are without law,
as without law, (being not without
law to God, but under the law to
Christ,) that I might gain them that
are without law.
22 To the weak became I as a weak,
that I might gain the weak: I am
made b all things to all men, that I
might by all means save some.
23 And this I do for the gospel’s
sake, that I might be partaker thereof
with you.
24 Know ye not that they which
run in a race run all, but one re- ceiveth the prize? So run, that ye
may obtain.
25 And every man that striveth
for the a mastery is b temperate in
all things. Now they do it to obtain
a corruptible c crown; but we an d incorruptible.
26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
beateth the air:
27 But I a keep under my b body,
and bring it into subjection: lest
that by any means, when I have
preached to others, I myself should
be a castaway.
Chapter 10
Christ is the God of Israel and the
spiritual Rock that guided them—
Ancient Israel rebelled against Christ
—Paul contrasts true and false
sacraments.
Moreover, brethren, I would not
that ye should be ignorant, how that
all our fathers were under the a cloud,
and all passed through the b sea;
2 And were all a baptized unto Mo- ses in the cloud and in the sea;
3 And did all eat the same spiritual a meat;
4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that
spiritual Rock that followed them:
and that a Rock was Christ.
5 But with many of them a God
was not well b pleased: for they were c overthrown in the d wilderness.
6 Now these things were our a examples, to the intent we should not
b lust after evil things, as they also
lusted.
7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were
some of them; as it is written, The
a people sat down to eat and drink,
and rose up to play.
8 Neither let us commit a fornica- tion, as some of them committed,

9 Neither let us a tempt Christ, as
some of them also tempted, and
were destroyed of serpents.
10 Neither a murmur ye, as some
of them also murmured, and were
b destroyed of the destroyer.
11 Now all these things happened
unto them for a ensamples: b and they
are c written for our d admonition,
upon whom the ends of the world
are come.
12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he a standeth take heed lest he b fall.
13 There hath no temptation a taken
you but such as is common to man:
but God is faithful, who will not
suffer you to be b tempted above
that ye are able; but will with the
c temptation also make a way to
d escape, that ye may be able to
e bear it.
14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved,
flee from a idolatry.
15 I speak as to wise men; judge
ye what I say.
16 The a cup of b blessing which we
bless, is it not the c communion of the
blood of Christ? The bread which
we break, is it not the communion
of the body of Christ?
17 For we being many are one bread,
and one body: for we are all partak- ers of that one bread.
18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are
not they which eat of the sacrifices
a partakers of the altar?
19 What say I then? that the idol
is any thing, or that which is of- fered in sacrifice to a idols is any
thing?
20 But I say, that the things which
the Gentiles sacrifice, they a sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I
would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
21 Ye cannot drink the a cup of the
Lord, and the cup of devils: ye can- not be partakers of the Lord’s table,
and of the table of devils.
22 Do we provoke the Lord to a jealousy ? are we stronger than he?
23 a All things are lawful for me,
but all things are not b expedient:
all things are lawful for me, but all
things c edify not.
24 Let no man seek his a own, but
every man another’s b wealth.
25 Whatsoever is sold in the a shambles, that eat, asking no question for
conscience sake:
26 For the a earth is the Lord’s, and
the fulness thereof.
27 If any of them that believe not
bid you to a a feast, and ye be dis- posed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for
conscience sake.
28 But if any man say unto you,
This is offered in sacrifice unto idols,
eat not for his sake that shewed it,
and for conscience sake: for the
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof:

Chapter 11
Paul speaks of certain customs of hair
and grooming—Heresies will arise
that test and prove the faithful—The
sacramental emblems are partaken
in remembrance of the flesh and
blood of Christ—Beware of partaking
unworthily.
Be ye a followers of me, even as I
also am of Christ.
2 Now I praise you, brethren, a that
ye remember me in all things, and
keep the b ordinances, as I delivered
them to you.
3 But I would have you know, that
the head of every man is Christ;
and the a head of the b woman is
the man; and the c head of Christ is
God.
4 Every man praying or prophe- sying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
5 But every woman that prayeth
or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for
that is a even all one as if she were
shaven.
6 For if the woman be not covered,
let her also be shorn: but if it be a
a shame for a woman to be shorn or
shaven, let her be covered.
7 For a man indeed ought not to
cover his head, forasmuch as he is
the image and glory of God: but
the woman is the glory of the man.
8 For the man is not of the woman;
but the woman of the man.
9 Neither was the man created
for the woman; but the woman for
the man.
10 For this cause ought the woman
to have power on her head because
of the angels.
11 Nevertheless neither is the a man without the woman, neither
the b woman without the man, in
the Lord.
12 For as the woman is of the
man, even so is the man also by the
woman; but all things of God.
13 Judge in yourselves: is it a comely
that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
14 Doth not even nature itself teach
you, that, if a man have long a hair,
it is a shame unto him?
15 But if a woman have long hair,
it is a glory to her: for her hair is
given her for a covering.
16 But if any man seem to be a con- tentious, we have no such custom,
neither the churches of God.

you I praise you not, that ye come
together not for the better, but for

together in the a church, I hear that
there be b divisions among you; and
I partly believe it.
19 For there must be also a heresies among you, that they which are
approved may be made manifest
among you.
20 When ye come together therefore into one place, a this is not to
eat the Lord’s supper.
21 For in eating every one taketh
before other his own supper: and one
is hungry, and another is drunken.
22 What? have ye not houses to eat
and to drink in? or despise ye the
a church of God, and b shame them
that have not? What shall I say to
you? shall I praise you in this? I
praise you not.
23 For I have received of the Lord
that which also I delivered unto you,
That the Lord Jesus the same night in
which he was betrayed took a bread:
24 And when he had given thanks,
he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this
is my body, which is broken for you:
this do in a remembrance of me.
25 After the same manner also he
took the cup, when he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as
oft as ye drink it, in remembrance
of me.
26 For as often as ye eat this a bread,
and drink this cup, ye do b shew the
Lord’s c death till he come.
27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat
this a bread, and drink this cup of the
Lord, b unworthily, shall c be d guilty
of the body and blood of the Lord.
28 But let a man a examine himself,
and so let him eat of that bread, and
drink of that cup.
29 For he that eateth and drinketh a unworthily, eateth and drinketh
b damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
30 For this cause many are weak
and a sickly among you, and many
sleep.
31 For if we would a judge ourselves,
we should not be judged.
32 But when we are judged, we
are a chastened of the Lord, that
we should not be condemned with
the world.
33 Wherefore, my brethren, when
ye come together to eat, tarry one
for another.
34 And if any man hunger, let him
eat at home; that ye come not to- gether unto condemnation. And the
rest will I set in order when I come.
Chapter 12
The Holy Ghost reveals that Jesus is the
Christ—Spiritual gifts are present among
the Saints—Apostles, prophets, and
miracles are found in the true Church.
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, a carried away unto these dumb
b idols, even as ye were led.
3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed:
and that no man can a say that Jesus
is the b Lord, but by the c Holy Ghost.

5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which
worketh all in all.
7 But the manifestation of the a Spirit is given to every man to
profit withal.
8 For to one is a given by the b Spirit
the c word of d wisdom; to another
the word of e knowledge by the
same Spirit;
9 To another a faith by the same
Spirit; to another the gifts of b healing by the same Spirit;
10 To another the working of a mira- cles; to another b prophecy; to another c discerning of spirits; to another
divers kinds of tongues; to another
the interpretation of d tongues:
11 But all these worketh that one
and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
to every man severally as he will.
12 For as the body is one, and hath
many members, and all the members of that one body, being many,
are one body: so also is Christ.
13 For by one Spirit are we all
baptized into one a body, whether
we be Jews or b Gentiles, whether we
be c bond or free; and have been all
made to drink into one Spirit.
14 For the body is not one mem- ber, but many.
15 If the foot shall say, Because
I am not the hand, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the
body ?
16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the
body ?
17 If the whole body were an eye,
where were the hearing? If the
whole were hearing, where were the
smelling?
18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body,
as it hath pleased him.
19 And if they were all one member, where were the body ?
20 But now are they many members,
yet but one body.
21 And the eye cannot say unto the
hand, I have no need of thee: nor
again the a head to the feet, I have
no need of you.
22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
a more feeble, are necessary:
23 And those members of the body,
which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more
abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant
comeliness.
24 For our comely parts have no
need: but God hath tempered the
body together, having given more
abundant honour to that part which
lacked:
25 That there should be no schism
in the body; but that the members
should have the same a care one for
another.
26 And whether one member a suffer, all the members b suffer with it;
or one member be honoured, all the
members rejoice with it.
27 Now ye are the body of a Christ,
and b members in particular.
28 And God hath set some in the
church, first a apostles, secondarily b prophets, thirdly c teachers, after
that miracles, then gifts of healings,
helps, d governments, diversities of
tongues.

Chapter 13
Paul discusses the high status of charity—Charity, a pure love, excels and
exceeds almost all else.
Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels, and have not
a charity, I am become as sounding
brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
2 And though I have the gift of a prophecy, and understand all
b mysteries, and all knowledge; and
though I have all faith, so that I
could remove mountains, and have
not charity, I am nothing.
3 And though I bestow all my goods
to feed the a poor, and though I give
my body to be burned, and have
not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
4 a Charity b suffereth long, and is c kind; charity d envieth not; charity
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
5 Doth not behave itself a unseemly, b seeketh not her own, is not easily
c provoked, thinketh no evil;
6 Rejoiceth not in a iniquity, but
rejoiceth in the b truth;
7 Beareth all things, believeth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things.
8 Charity never a faileth: but
whether there be prophecies, they
shall fail; whether there be tongues,
they shall cease; whether there be
knowledge, it shall vanish away.
9 For we know in part, and we
prophesy in part.
10 But when that which is perfect
is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away.
11 When I was a child, I spake as
a child, I understood as a child, I
thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish
things.
12 For now we see through a a glass, b darkly; but then face to face: now I
know in part; but then shall I know
even as also I am known.
13 And now abideth a faith, b hope, c charity, these three; but the great- est of these is charity.
Chapter 14
People should desire spiritual gifts—
Tongues and prophecy are compared—
Prophecy is the greater gift—Paul says,
You may all prophesy; covet to prophesy.
a Follow after charity, and desire
spiritual b gifts, but rather that ye
may prophesy.
2 For he that speaketh in a an unknown tongue speaketh not unto
men, but unto God: for no man
understandeth him; howbeit in the
spirit he speaketh mysteries.
3 But he that a prophesieth speak- eth unto men to b edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.
4 He that speaketh in an unknown
tongue edifieth himself; but he that
prophesieth edifieth the church.

1455 1 Corinthians 14:5–26
5 I a would that ye all spake with
tongues, but rather that ye b prophe- sied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with
tongues, except he interpret, that
the church may receive edifying.
6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you
speaking with tongues, what shall
I profit you, a except I shall speak
to you either by b revelation, or by
knowledge, or by prophesying, or
by doctrine?
7 And even things without life
giving sound, whether pipe or harp,
except they give a distinction in the
sounds, how shall it be known what
is piped or harped?
8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
himself to the battle?
9 So likewise ye, except ye utter
by the tongue words easy to be
understood, how shall it be known
what is spoken? for ye shall speak
into the air.
10 There are, it may be, so many
kinds of a voices in the world, and
none of them is without signification.
11 Therefore if I know not the
meaning of the voice, I shall be unto
him that speaketh a barbarian, and
he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
12 Even so ye, a forasmuch as ye
are zealous of spiritual b gifts, seek
that ye may excel to the c edifying
of the church.
13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
he may interpret.
14 For if I pray in an unknown
tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
a understanding is unfruitful.
15 What is it then? I will pray with
the spirit, and I will pray with the
understanding also: I will sing with
the spirit, and I will sing with the
understanding also.
16 Else when thou shalt bless with
the spirit, how shall he that occu- pieth the room of the unlearned
say Amen at thy giving of thanks,
seeing he understandeth not what
thou sayest?
17 For thou verily givest thanks
well, but the other is not edified.
18 I thank my God, I speak with
tongues more than ye all:
19 Yet in the church I had rather a speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might
teach others also, than ten thousand
words in an unknown tongue.
20 Brethren, be not a children in b understanding: howbeit in c malice
be ye children, but in d understanding be men.
21 In the law it is written, With
men of other tongues and other lips
will I speak unto this people; and
yet for all that will they not a hear
me, saith the Lord.
22 Wherefore a tongues are for a b sign, not to them that believe, but to
them that believe not: but c prophesying serveth not for them that be- lieve not, but for them which believe.
23 If therefore the whole church be
come together into one place, and
all speak with tongues, and there
come in those that are unlearned, or a unbelievers, will they not say that
ye are mad?
24 But if all prophesy, and there
come in one that believeth not, or
one unlearned, he is convinced of
all, he is judged of all:
25 And thus are the a secrets of his
heart made manifest; and so falling
down on his face he will worship
God, and report that God is in you
of a truth.

ye come together, every one of you

done unto a edifying.
27 If any man speak in an unknown
tongue, let it be by two, or at the most
by three, and that by course; and let
one interpret.
28 But if there be no interpreter,
let him keep a silence in the church;
and let him speak to himself, and
to God.
29 Let the prophets speak two or
three, and let the other judge.
30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first
hold his peace.
31 For ye may all prophesy one
by one, that all may learn, and all
may be comforted.

are subject to the prophets.

in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to b speak; but they are
commanded c to be under d obedience,
as also saith the law.
35 And if they will learn any thing,
let them ask their husbands at home:
for it is a shame for women to a speak
in the church.
36 What? came the word of God
out from you? or came it unto
you only ?
37 If any man think himself to
be a prophet, or spiritual, let him
acknowledge that the things that I
write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
38 But if any man be ignorant, let
him be ignorant.
39 Wherefore, brethren, a covet to
prophesy, and forbid not to speak
with tongues.
40 Let all things be done decently
and in a order.
Chapter 15
Christ died for our sins—He rose from
the dead and was seen by many—All
men will be resurrected—Paul speaks
of baptism for the dead—The three degrees of glory are described—Victory
over death comes through Christ.
Moreover, brethren, I a declare unto
you the b gospel which I preached
unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2 By which also ye are a saved, if ye b keep in memory what I preached
unto you, unless ye have believed
in vain.
3 For I delivered unto you first of
all that which I also received, how
that Christ a died for our b sins according to the scriptures;
4 And that he was buried, and that
he a rose again the third day accord- ing to the scriptures:
5 And that he was a seen of b Cephas,
then of the twelve:
6 After that, he was a seen of b above
five hundred brethren at once; of
whom the greater part remain unto
this present, but some are fallen
asleep.
7 After that, he was seen of James;
then of all the apostles.
8 And last of all he was a seen of me
also, as of one born out of due time.
9 For I am the least of the apostles,
that am not a meet to be called an

apostle, because I b persecuted the
church of God.
10 But by the a grace of God I am
what I am: and his grace which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain;
but I b laboured more abundantly
than they all: yet not I, but the grace
of God which was with me.
11 Therefore whether it were I or
they, so we preach, and so ye be- lieved.
12 Now if Christ be preached that
he rose from the dead, how say some
among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
13 But if there be no resurrec- tion of the dead, then is Christ not
risen:
14 And if Christ be not risen, then
is our preaching vain, and your faith
is also vain.
15 Yea, and we are found false
witnesses of God; because we have
a testified of God that he raised up
Christ: whom he raised not up, if
so be that the dead rise not.
16 For if the dead rise not, then is
not Christ raised:
17 And if Christ be not raised, your
faith is a vain; ye are yet in your sins.
18 Then they also which are fallen
asleep in Christ are a perished.
19 If in this a life only we have b hope in Christ, we are of all men
most miserable.
20 But now is a Christ b risen from
the dead, and become the c firstfruits
of them that slept.
21 For since by man came a death,
by man came also the b resurrection
of the dead.
22 For as in a Adam all b die, even so
in c Christ shall all be made d alive.
23 But every man in his own a order: Christ the b firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his
c coming.
24 Then cometh the end, when he
shall have delivered up the kingdom
to God, even the Father; when he
shall have a put down all b rule and
all c authority and d power.
25 For he must a reign, till he hath
put all b enemies under his c feet.
26 The last a enemy that shall be b destroyed is c death.
27 For he hath put all things un- der his feet. But when he saith all
things are put under him, it is a manifest that he is excepted, which did
put all things under him.
28 And when all things shall be a subdued unto him, then shall the
Son also himself be b subject unto
him that put all things under him,
that God may be all in all.
29 Else what shall they do which
are a baptized b for the dead, if the
dead c rise not at all? why are they
then baptized for the d dead?
30 And why stand we in a jeopardy
every hour?

1 Corinthians 15:31–52 1458
31 a I protest by your rejoicing
which I have in Christ Jesus our
Lord, I die daily.
32 If after the manner of men I
have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
what advantageth it me, if the dead
rise not? let us a eat and drink; for b to morrow we die.
33 Be not deceived: evil a communications corrupt good manners.
34 Awake to righteousness, and sin
not; for some have not the knowledge
of God: I speak this to your a shame.
35 But some man will say, How are
the dead raised up? and with what
body do they come?
36 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it a die:
37 And that which thou sowest,
thou sowest not that body that shall
be, but bare grain, a it may chance
of wheat, or of some other grain:
38 But God giveth it a body as it
hath pleased him, and to every seed
his own body.
39 All flesh is not the same flesh:
but there is one kind of flesh of men,
another flesh of beasts, another of
fishes, and another of birds.
40 a There are also celestial bodies,
and bodies terrestrial: but the glory
of the b celestial is one, and the
glory of the c terrestrial is another.
41 There is one glory of the a sun,
and another glory of the moon, and
another glory of the b stars: for one
star c differeth from another star in d glory.
42 So also is the resurrection of the
dead. It is sown in a corruption; it is
raised in incorruption:
43 It is sown in dishonour; it is
raised in a glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
44 It is sown a a natural body; it is
raised a b spiritual body. There is a
natural body, and there is a spiri- tual body.
45 And so it is written, The a first
man b Adam was made a living soul;
the last c Adam was made a d quickening spirit.
46 Howbeit that was not a first
which is spiritual, but that which is
natural; and afterward that which
is spiritual.
47 The first man is of the earth,
earthy: the second man is the Lord
from heaven.
48 As is the earthy, such are they
also that are earthy: and as is the
heavenly, such are they also that
are heavenly.
49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear
the image of the heavenly.
50 Now this I say, brethren, that a flesh and b blood cannot c inherit
the kingdom of God; neither doth
d corruption inherit incorruption.
51 Behold, I shew you a mystery;
We shall not all a sleep, but we shall
all be b changed,
52 In a moment, in the a twinkling
of an eye, at the last trump: for the
b trumpet shall sound, and the c dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and
we shall be d changed.
31a jst 1 Cor. 15:31 I protest

of the dead; and this is my

53 For this a corruptible must put
on incorruption, and this b mortal
must put on immortality.
54 So when this corruptible shall
have put on incorruption, and this
mortal shall have put on a immortality, then shall be brought to pass
the saying that is written, b Death is
swallowed up in victory.
55 O a death, where is thy sting? O b grave, where is thy victory ?
56 The sting of a death is sin; and
the b strength of sin is the law.
57 But a thanks be to God, which
giveth us the b victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ.
58 Therefore, my beloved brethren,
be ye a steadfast, unmoveable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord,
forasmuch as ye know that your
labour is not in vain in the Lord.
Chapter 16
Paul counsels, Stand fast in the faith;
let all things be done with charity.
Now concerning the a collection for
the saints, as I have b given order
to the churches of Galatia, even so
do ye.
2 Upon the a first day of the week let
every one of you lay by him in store,
as God hath b prospered him, that
there be no gatherings when I come.
3 And when I come, whomsoever ye
shall approve by your letters, them
will I send to bring your a liberality
unto Jerusalem.
4 And if it be a meet that I go also,
they shall go with me.
5 Now I will come unto you, when
I shall pass through Macedonia: for
I do pass through Macedonia.
6 And it may be that I will abide,
yea, and winter with you, that ye
may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
7 For I will not see you now a by the
way; but I b trust to c tarry a while
with you, if the Lord permit.
8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until
Pentecost.
9 For a great a door and b effectual
is opened unto me, and there are
many adversaries.
10 Now if a Timotheus come, see
that he may be with you without
fear: for he worketh the work of the
Lord, as I also do.
11 Let no man therefore a despise
him: but conduct him forth in peace,
that he may come unto me: for I look
for him with the brethren.
12 As touching our brother a Apol- los, I greatly desired him to come
unto you with the brethren: but his
will was not at all to come at this
time; but he will come when he
shall have convenient time.
13 a Watch ye, b stand fast in the c faith, d quit you like e men, be strong.
14 Let all your things be done with a charity.
15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye
know the house of a Stephanas, that it
is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that
they have b addicted themselves to
the ministry of the saints,)
16 That ye submit yourselves unto
such, and to every one that helpeth
with us, and laboureth.
17 I am glad of the coming of
Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Achaicus: for that which was a lacking on your part they have supplied.

The Second Epistle of
Paul the Apostle to the
Corinthians
Chapter 1
God comforts and cares for His Saints—
The Saints are sealed and given assur­ ance by the Spirit in their hearts.
Paul, an a apostle of Jesus
Christ by the will of God, and
Timothy our brother, unto the
church of God which is at Corinth,
with all the saints which are in all
Achaia:
2 Grace be to you and peace from
God our Father, and from the Lord
Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be God, even the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
of a mercies, and the God of all b comfort;
4 Who comforteth us in all our a tribulation, that we may be able
to comfort them which are in any
trouble, by the b comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted
of God.
5 For as the a sufferings of Christ
abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ.
6 And whether we be afflicted, it is
for your consolation and salvation,
which is a effectual in the b endur­ ing of the same sufferings which
we also suffer: or whether we be
comforted, it is for your consolation
and salvation.
7 And our hope of you is steadfast,
knowing, that as ye are partakers of
the a sufferings, so shall ye be also
of the consolation.
8 For we would not, brethren,
have you ignorant of our trouble
which came to us in Asia, that we
were pressed out of measure, above
strength, insomuch that we a despaired even of life:
1461 2 Corinthians 1:9–2:7
9 But we had the sentence of death
in ourselves, that we should not
trust in ourselves, but in God which
a raiseth the dead:
10 Who a delivered us from so great
a death, and doth deliver: in whom
we trust that he will yet deliver us;
11 Ye also helping together by a prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of
many persons thanks may be given
by many on our behalf.
12 For our rejoicing is this, the a testimony of our conscience, that
in b simplicity and godly sincerity,
not with fleshly c wisdom, but by
the grace of God, we have had our
conversation in the world, and more
abundantly to you-ward.
13 For we a write none other
things unto you, than what ye read
or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall
acknowledge even to the end;
14 As also ye have acknowledged
us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the a day of the Lord Jesus.
15 And in this confidence I was
minded to a come unto you before,
that ye might have a second benefit;
16 And to pass by you into Mace- donia, and to come again out of
Macedonia unto you, and of you to
be brought on my way toward Judæa.
17 When I therefore was thus
minded, did I use a lightness? or the
things that I purpose, do I purpose
according to the flesh, that with me
there should be yea yea, and nay
nay ?
18 But as God is true, our word
toward you was not yea and nay.
19 For the a Son of God, Jesus Christ,
who was preached among you by
us, even by me and b Silvanus and c Timotheus, was not yea and nay,
but in him was yea.
20 For all the a promises of God in
him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
the glory of God by us.
21 Now he which stablisheth
us with you in Christ, and hath
a anointed us, is God;
22 Who hath also a sealed us, and
given the earnest of the Spirit in
our hearts.
23 Moreover I call God for a record
upon my soul, that to spare you I
came not as yet unto Corinth.
24 Not for that we have dominion
over your faith, but are helpers of
your joy: for by a faith ye stand.
Chapter 2
Saints should love and forgive one
another—They always triumph in
Christ.
But I determined this with myself,
that I would not come again to you
in heaviness.
2 For if I make you sorry, who is he
then that maketh me glad, but the
same which is made sorry by me?
3 And I wrote this same unto you,
lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to
rejoice; having a confidence in you
all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
4 For out of much affliction and
anguish of heart I wrote unto you
with many tears; not that ye should
be grieved, but that ye might know
the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
5 But if any have caused grief, he
hath not grieved me, but in part:
that I may not overcharge you all.
6 Sufficient to such a man is this
punishment, which was inflicted of
many.
7 So that contrariwise ye ought
rather to a forgive him, and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one should

be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow.
8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye
would confirm your love toward him.
9 For to this end also did I a write,
that I might know the proof of
you, whether ye be b obedient in all
things.
10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I
forgive also: for if I forgave any thing,
to whom I forgave it, for your sakes
forgave I it in the a person of Christ;
11 Lest a Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant
of his devices.
12 Furthermore, when I came to
Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and
a a door was opened unto me of the
Lord,
13 I had no rest in my spirit, be- cause I found not Titus my brother:
but taking my leave of them, I went
from thence into Macedonia.
14 Now thanks be unto God, which
always causeth us to a triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the
savour of his knowledge by us in
every place.
15 For we are unto God a sweet
savour of Christ, in them that are
saved, and in them that perish:
16 To the one we are the savour of
death unto death; and to the other
the savour of life unto life. And
who is a sufficient for these things?
17 For we are not as many, which a corrupt the b word of God: but as of c sincerity, but as of God, in the sight
of God speak we in Christ.
Chapter 3
The gospel surpasses the law of Moses
—Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty.
Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others,
epistles of commendation to you, or
letters of commendation from you?
2 Ye are our a epistle written in our
hearts, known and read of all men:
3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly
declared to be the epistle of Christ
ministered by us, a written not with
ink, but with the Spirit of the living
God; not in b tables of stone, but in c fleshy tables of the d heart.
4 And such trust have we through
Christ to God-ward:
5 Not that we are sufficient of
ourselves to think any thing as of
ourselves; but our a sufficiency is
of God;
6 Who also hath made us able a ministers of the new testament;
not of the letter, but of the spirit:
for the letter killeth, but the b spirit
giveth life.
7 But if the ministration of a death,
written and engraven in stones, was
glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold
the face of Moses for the b glory of
his countenance; which glory was to
be done away:
8 How shall not the ministration
of the spirit be rather glorious?
9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth
the ministration of righteousness
exceed in glory.
10 For even that which was made
glorious had no glory in this respect,
by reason of the glory that excelleth.
11 For if that which is done away
was glorious, much more that which
remaineth is glorious.
12 Seeing then that we have such
hope, we use great a plainness of
speech:
13 And not as Moses, which put a
veil over his face, that the children

of Israel could not steadfastly look to
the end of that which is abolished:
14 But their a minds were b blinded:
for until this day remaineth the same
veil untaken away in the c reading
of the old testament; which d veil is
done away in Christ.
15 But even unto this day, when
Moses is read, the veil is upon their
a heart.
16 Nevertheless when it shall turn
to the Lord, the veil shall be taken
away.
17 Now the Lord is a that Spirit:
and where the b Spirit of the Lord
is, there is c liberty.
18 But we all, with open face be- holding as in a a glass the b glory of
the Lord, are changed into the same
c image from d glory to glory, even as
by the Spirit of the Lord.
Chapter 4
Gospel light shines on the Saints—Mortal trials are nothing as contrasted with
eternal glory.
Therefore seeing we have this min- istry, as we have received a mercy,
we faint not;
2 But have a renounced the hidden
things of b dishonesty, not walking
in craftiness, nor handling the word
of God c deceitfully; but by manifes- tation of the d truth commending
ourselves to every man’s e conscience
in the sight of God.
3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid
to them that are lost:
4 In whom the a god of this b world
hath c blinded the d minds of them
which e believe not, lest the f light of
the glorious gospel of Christ, who
is the g image of h God, should shine
unto them.
5 For we a preach not ourselves, but
Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves
your b servants for Jesus’ sake.
6 For God, who a commanded the
light to shine out of darkness, hath
b shined in our hearts, to give the c light of the knowledge of the d glory
of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
7 But we have this treasure in
earthen vessels, that the excellency
of the a power may be of God, and
not of us.
8 We are a troubled on every side,
yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not in b despair;
9 a Persecuted, but not forsaken;
cast down, but not b destroyed;
10 Always bearing about in the
body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
that the life also of Jesus might be
made manifest in our body.
11 For we which live are alway de- livered unto a death for Jesus’ sake,
that the life also of Jesus might
be made manifest in our b mortal
flesh.

but life in you.

faith, according as it is written, I
a believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
b speak;
14 Knowing that he which raised
up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us
also by Jesus, and shall present us
with you.
15 For all things are for your sakes,
that the abundant grace might
through the a thanksgiving of many
redound to the glory of God.
16 For which cause we faint not;
but though our outward man perish, yet the a inward man is renewed
day by day.
17 For our light a affliction, which
is but for a moment, worketh for us
a far more exceeding and b eternal c weight of glory;
18 While we look not at the
things which are a seen, but at
the things which are not seen: for
the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are
not b seen are c eternal.
Chapter 5
Saints walk by faith and seek tabernacles of immortal glory—The gospel
reconciles man to God—God’s ministers carry the word of reconciliation
to the world.
For we know that if our earthly
house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God,
an house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens.
2 For in this we groan, earnestly
desiring to be a clothed upon with
our house which is from heaven:
3 If so be that being clothed we
shall not be found naked.
4 For we that are in this tabernacle
do a groan, being burdened: not for
that we would be unclothed, but
clothed upon, that b mortality might
be swallowed up of life.
5 Now he that hath wrought us
for the selfsame thing is God, who
also hath given unto us the earnest
of the Spirit.
6 Therefore we are always a confident, knowing that, whilst we are
at home in the body, we are absent
from the Lord:
7 (For we walk by a faith, not by b sight:)
8 We are confident, I say, and will- ing rather to be absent from the body,
and to be present with the Lord.
9 Wherefore we a labour, that,
whether present or absent, we may
be accepted of him.
10 For we must all appear before
the a judgment seat of Christ; that
every one may receive the things
done in his body, b according to that
he hath c done, whether it be good
or bad.
11 Knowing therefore the terror
of the Lord, we persuade men; but
we are made manifest unto God;
and I trust also are made manifest
in your a consciences.
12 For we commend not ourselves
again unto you, but give you occa- sion to glory on our behalf, that ye
may have somewhat to answer them
which glory in appearance, and not
in heart.
13 a For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we
be sober, it is for your cause.
14 For the love of Christ con- straineth us; because we thus judge,
that if a one b died for all, then were
all dead:
15 And that he died for all, that

unto him which died for them, and
rose again.
16 a Wherefore henceforth know
we no man after the flesh: yea,
though we have known Christ after
the flesh, yet now henceforth know
we him no more.
17 Therefore if any man be a in
Christ, he is a b new creature: c old
things are d passed away; behold,
all things are become e new.
18 And all things are of God, who
hath a reconciled us to himself by
Jesus Christ, and hath given to us
the ministry of reconciliation;
19 To wit, that God was in Christ, a reconciling the world unto himself,
not imputing their trespasses unto
them; and hath committed unto us
the word of reconciliation.
20 Now then we are a ambassadors
for Christ, as though God did beseech
you by us: we pray you in Christ’s
stead, be ye reconciled to God.
21 For he hath made him to be a sin
for us, who knew no b sin; that we
might be made the c righteousness
of God in him.
Chapter 6
Now is the day of salvation—God’s min- isters must walk uprightly and bear all
things—Saints should not be unequally
yoked with unbelievers.
We then, as a workers together with b him, beseech you also that ye
receive not the c grace of God in vain.
2 (For he saith, I have heard thee
in a a time accepted, and in the b day of c salvation have I succoured
thee: behold, now is the accepted
time; behold, now is the day of
salvation.)
3 Giving no a offence in any thing,
that the ministry be not blamed:
4 But in all things approving ourselves as the a ministers of God, in
much b patience, in c afflictions, in
necessities, in distresses,
5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in a tumults, in labours, in watchings,
in fastings;
6 By a pureness, by knowledge, by b longsuffering, by c kindness, by the
Holy Ghost, by d love unfeigned,
7 By the word of truth, by the
power of God, by the a armour of b righteousness on the right hand
and on the left,
8 By honour and dishonour, by evil
report and good report: as deceivers,
and yet true;
9 As unknown, and yet well known;
as dying, and, behold, we live; as
chastened, and not killed;
10 As a sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as b poor, yet making many c rich;
as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
11 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is
open unto you, our heart is a enlarged.
12 Ye are not straitened in us,
but ye are straitened in your own

and ye shall be my b sons and daugh- ters, saith the Lord c Almighty.
Chapter 7
Godly sorrow for sin leads to repentance—The sorrow of the world leads
to death.
Having therefore these promises,
dearly beloved, let us a cleanse our- selves from all b filthiness of the flesh
and spirit, perfecting c holiness in
the fear of God.
2 Receive us; we have a wronged no
man, we have corrupted no man, we
have b defrauded no man.
3 I speak not this to condemn
you: for I have said before, that ye
are in our hearts to die and live
with you.
4 Great is my boldness of speech
toward you, great is my glorying
of you: I am filled with a comfort,
I am exceeding b joyful in all our c tribulation.
5 For, when we were come into
Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
but we were a troubled on every
side; without were fightings, within
were b fears.
6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, com- forted us by the coming of Titus;
7 And not by his coming only, but
by the consolation wherewith he was
a comforted in you, when he told us
your earnest desire, your mourning,
your fervent mind toward me; so
that I rejoiced the more.
8 For though I made you sorry with
a letter, I do not repent, though I did
repent: for I perceive that the same
epistle hath made you sorry, though
it were but for a season.
9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were
made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to
repentance: for ye were made a sorry
after a godly manner, that ye might
receive damage by us in nothing.
10 For a godly b sorrow worketh c repentance to d salvation not to be
repented of: but the e sorrow of the
world worketh death.
11 For behold this selfsame thing,
that ye sorrowed after a godly sort,
what carefulness it wrought in
you, yea, what clearing of yourselves,
yea, what indignation, yea, what
fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea,
what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all
things ye have approved yourselves
to be clear in this matter.

12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto
you, I did it not for his cause that
had done the wrong, nor for his
cause that suffered wrong, but that
our care for you in the sight of God
might appear unto you.
13 Therefore we were comforted
in your comfort: yea, and exceed- ingly the more joyed we for the joy
of Titus, because his spirit was a refreshed by you all.
14 For if I have a boasted any thing
to him of you, I am not ashamed;
but as we spake all things to you
in truth, even so our b boasting,
which I made before Titus, is found
a truth.
15 And his a inward affection is
more abundant toward you, whilst
he remembereth the b obedience of
you all, how with fear and trembling
ye received him.
16 I rejoice therefore that I have
confidence in you in all things.
Chapter 8
True Saints impart of their substance
to the poor—Christ, out of His poverty,
brought eternal riches.
Moreover, brethren, a we do you to
wit of the grace of God bestowed on
the churches of Macedonia;
2 How that in a great a trial of b af- fliction the abundance of their joy
and their deep c poverty abounded
unto the riches of their d liberality.
3 For to their power, I bear record,
yea, and beyond their power they
were willing of themselves;
4 Praying us with much entreaty
that we would receive the gift, and
take upon us the a fellowship of the
ministering to the saints.
5 And this they did, not as we hoped,
but first a gave their own selves to
the Lord, and unto us by the will
of God.
6 Insomuch that we desired Titus,
that as he had begun, so he would
also finish in you the same grace also.
7 Therefore, as ye abound in every
thing, in faith, and utterance, and
knowledge, and in all a diligence,
and in your love to us, see that ye
abound in this grace also.
8 I speak a not by commandment,
but by occasion of the forwardness
of others, and to prove the b sincerity of your love.
9 For ye know the a grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
was b rich, yet for your sakes he
became c poor, that ye through his d poverty might be rich.
10 And herein I give my advice:
for this is expedient for you, who
have begun before, not only to do,
but also to be forward a year ago.
11 Now therefore perform the do- ing of it; that as there was a readiness
to will, so there may be a performance
also out of that which ye have.
12 For if there be first a a willing b mind, it is accepted according to
that a man hath, and not according
to that he hath not.
13 For I mean not that other men
be eased, and ye burdened:
14 But by an equality, that now at
this time your abundance may be
a supply for their want, that their a abundance also may be a supply
for your want: that there may be
b equality:
15 As it is written, He that had a gathered much had nothing over;
and he that had gathered little had
no lack.
16 But thanks be to God, which
put the same earnest care into the
heart of Titus for you.

17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,
of his own accord he went unto you.
18 And we have sent with him
the brother, whose praise is in the
gospel throughout all the churches;
19 And not that only, but who was
also chosen of the churches to travel
with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the
same Lord, and declaration of your
ready mind:
20 Avoiding this, that no man
should blame us in this abundance
which is administered by us:
21 Providing for a honest things,
not only in the sight of the Lord,
but also in the b sight of men.
22 And we have sent with them our
brother, whom we have oftentimes
proved diligent in many things, but
now much more diligent, upon the
great a confidence which I have in
you.
23 Whether any do inquire of Titus,
he is my partner and fellowhelper
concerning you: or our brethren
be inquired of, they are the messen- gers of the churches, and the glory
of Christ.
24 Wherefore shew ye to them,
and before the churches, the proof
of your love, and of our boasting on
your behalf.
Chapter 9
God loves and rewards a cheerful
giver—Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift.
For as touching the ministering to
the saints, it is superfluous for me
to write to you:
2 For I know the forwardness of
your mind, for which I a boast of you
to them of Macedonia, that Achaia
was ready a year ago; and your zeal
hath b provoked very many.
3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest
our boasting of you should be in
vain in this behalf; that, as I said,
ye may be ready:
4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia
come with me, and find you un- prepared, we (that we say not, ye)
should be ashamed in this same
confident boasting.
5 Therefore I thought it necessary
to exhort the brethren, that they
would go before unto you, and
make up beforehand your a bounty,
whereof ye had notice before, that
the same might be ready, as a matter
of bounty, and not as of covetousness.
6 But this I say, He which soweth
sparingly shall a reap also sparingly;
and he which b soweth bountifully
shall reap also bountifully.
7 Every man according as he a purposeth in his heart, so let him give;
not b grudgingly, or of necessity: for
God loveth a c cheerful d giver.
8 And God is able to make all a grace
abound toward you; that ye, always
having all sufficiency in all things,
may abound to every good work:
9 (As it is written, He hath dis- persed abroad; he hath given to the
poor: his righteousness remaineth
for ever.
10 Now he that ministereth seed
to the sower both minister bread
for your food, and multiply your
seed sown, and increase the fruits
of your a righteousness;)
11 Being enriched in every thing
to all bountifulness, which causeth
through us a thanksgiving to God.
12 For the a administration of this
service not only supplieth the want
of the saints, but is abundant also
by many thanksgivings unto God;
13 Whiles by the experiment of
this ministration they glorify God
for your professed subjection unto
the gospel of Christ, and for your
liberal distribution unto them, and
unto all men;

be bold when I am present with that
confidence, wherewith I think to
be bold against some, which think
of us as if we walked according to
the flesh.
3 For though we walk in the flesh,
we do not a war after the flesh:
4 (For the a weapons of our b warfare
are not carnal, but mighty through
God to the pulling down of strong
holds;)
5 Casting down imaginations, and
every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God,
and bringing into captivity every
a thought to the b obedience of Christ;
6 And having in a readiness to re- venge all a disobedience, when your b obedience is fulfilled.
7 Do ye look on things after the
outward a appearance? If any man
trust to himself that he is Christ’s,
let him of himself think this again,
that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we b Christ’s.
8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our a authority, which
the Lord hath given us for b edifica- tion, and not for your destruction,
I should not be ashamed:
9 That I may not seem as if I would
terrify you by letters.
10 For his letters, say they, are
weighty and powerful; but his a bodily presence is weak, and his speech b contemptible.
11 Let such an one think this,
that, such as we are in word by
letters when we are absent, such
will we be also in deed when we are
present.
12 For we dare not make ourselves
of the number, or compare ourselves
with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves,
are not wise.
13 But we will not a boast of things
without our measure, but according
to the measure of the rule which
God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
14 For we stretch not ourselves
beyond our measure, as though we
reached not unto you: for we are
come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:
15 Not boasting of things without
our measure, that is, of other men’s a labours; but having hope, when
your faith is increased, that we shall
be enlarged by you according to our
rule abundantly,
16 To preach the gospel in the re- gions beyond you, and not to boast in
another man’s line of things made
ready to our hand.
17 But he that glorieth, let him a glory in the Lord.
18 For not he that a commendeth
himself is approved, but whom the
Lord commendeth.

2 Corinthians 11:1–23 1470
Would to God ye could bear with
me a little in my folly: and indeed
bear with me.
2 For I am a jealous over you with
godly jealousy: for I have b espoused you to one husband, that I
may present you as a chaste virgin
to Christ.
3 But I fear, lest by any means, as
the a serpent b beguiled Eve through
his c subtilty, so your minds should
be d corrupted from the e simplicity
that is in Christ.
4 For if he that cometh preacheth
another a Jesus, whom we have not
preached, or if ye receive another
spirit, which ye have not received,
or another b gospel, which ye have
not accepted, ye might well bear
with him.
5 For I suppose I was not a whit
behind the very chiefest apostles.
6 But though I be a rude in speech,
yet not in knowledge; but we have
been throughly made manifest
among you in all things.
7 Have I committed an offence in
abasing myself that ye might be
exalted, because I have preached
to you the gospel of God a freely ?
8 I a robbed other churches, taking b wages of them, to do you service.
9 And when I was present with
you, and wanted, I was a chargeable
to no man: for that which was b lack- ing to me the brethren which came
from Macedonia c supplied: and in
all things I have kept myself from
being burdensome unto you, and
so will I keep myself.
10 As the truth of Christ is in me,
no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
11 Wherefore? because I love you
not? God knoweth.
12 But what I do, that I will do,
that I may cut off occasion from
them which desire occasion; that
wherein they a glory, they may be
found even as we.
13 For such are a false apostles,
deceitful workers, transforming
themselves into the apostles of
Christ.
14 And no marvel; for a Satan himself is transformed into an b angel
of light.
15 Therefore it is no great thing if
his ministers also be transformed
as the ministers of righteousness;
whose a end shall be according to
their works.
16 I say again, Let no man think
me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool
a receive me, that I may b boast myself a little.
17 That which I speak, I speak it not
after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
18 Seeing that many glory after
the flesh, I will glory also.
19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
20 For ye suffer, if a man bring
you into a bondage, if a man devour
you, if a man take of you, if a man
exalt himself, if a man smite you
on the face.
21 I speak as concerning a reproach,
as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I
speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
22 Are they a Hebrews? so am I. Are
they b Israelites? so am I. Are they
the seed of Abraham? so am I.
23 Are they a ministers of Christ?

(I speak as a fool) b I am more; in c labours more abundant, in d stripes
above measure, in e prisons more
frequent, in deaths oft.
24 Of the Jews five times received
I a forty stripes save one.
25 Thrice was I a beaten with rods,
once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
shipwreck, a night and a day I have
been in the deep;
26 In journeyings often, in perils
of waters, in perils of robbers, in
perils by mine own a countrymen,
in perils by the b heathen, in c perils
in the city, in perils in the wilder- ness, in perils in the sea, in perils
among false brethren;
27 In a weariness and b painfulness,
in watchings often, in hunger and
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and
nakedness.
28 Beside those things that
are without, that which cometh
upon me daily, the care of all the
churches.
29 Who is weak, and I am not a weak? who is offended, and I
b burn not?
30 If I must needs glory, I will glory
of the things which concern mine
infirmities.
31 The God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
for evermore, knoweth that I lie
not.
32 In Damascus the governor under
Aretas the king kept the city of the

33 And through a window in a
basket was I let down by the wall,
and escaped his hands.
Chapter 12
Paul is caught up to the third heaven—
The Lord gives men weaknesses that
they may triumph over them—Paul
manifests the signs of an Apostle.
It is not expedient for me doubtless
to a glory. I will come to b visions and c revelations of the Lord.
2 a I knew a man in Christ above
fourteen years ago, (whether in
the b body, I cannot tell; or whether
out of the body, I cannot tell: God
knoweth;) such an one caught up
to the c third d heaven.
3 And I knew such a man, (whether
in the body, or out of the body, I
cannot tell: God knoweth;)
4 How that he was caught up into a paradise, and heard b unspeakable
words, which it is c not d lawful for a
man to utter.
5 Of such an one will I glory: yet
of myself I will not a glory, but in
mine infirmities.
6 For though I would desire to
glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will
say the truth: but now I forbear, lest
any man should think of me above
that which he seeth me to be, or that
he heareth of me.
7 And lest I should be a exalted
above measure through the abun- dance of the revelations, there was
given to me a b thorn in the flesh,
the messenger of Satan to buffet
me, lest I should be exalted above
measure.
8 For this thing I besought the
Lord thrice, that it might depart
from me.

is made perfect in c weakness. Most
gladly therefore will I rather glory
in my infirmities, that the power of
Christ may d rest upon me.
10 Therefore I take pleasure in a infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in b persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I
am c weak, then am I d strong.
11 I am become a fool in glorying;
ye have compelled me: for I ought to
have been commended of you: for in
nothing am I behind the very a chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
12 Truly the a signs of an apostle
were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and
mighty deeds.
13 For what is it wherein ye were
inferior to other churches, except
it be that I myself was not a burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
14 Behold, the third time I am
ready to come to you; and I will not
be burdensome to you: for I a seek
not yours, but you: for the children
ought not to lay up for the parents,
but the parents for the children.
15 And I will very gladly spend
and be spent for you; though the
more abundantly I love you, the
less I be loved.
16 But be it so, I did not burden
you: nevertheless, being crafty, I
caught you with guile.
17 Did I make a gain of you by
any of them whom I sent unto you?
18 I desired Titus, and with him
I sent a brother. Did Titus make a
gain of you? walked we not in the
same spirit? walked we not in the
same steps?
19 Again, think ye that we excuse
ourselves unto you? we speak before
God in Christ: but we do all things,
dearly beloved, for your a edifying.
20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I
shall not find you such as I would,
and that I shall be found unto you
such as ye would not: lest there be
debates, envyings, wraths, a strifes, b backbitings, whisperings, swellings, c tumults:
21 And lest, when I come again, my
God will humble me among you,
and that I shall bewail many which
have sinned already, and have not
repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which
they have committed.
Chapter 13
Saints should test themselves as to
righteousness—Be perfect and of one
mind; live in peace.
This is the third time I am coming
to you. In the mouth of two or three
a witnesses shall every word be es- tablished.
2 I told you before, and foretell
you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now
I write to them which heretofore
have sinned, and to all other, that,
if I come again, I will not spare:
3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ
speaking in me, which to you-ward
is not weak, but is mighty in you.
4 For though he was a crucified
through weakness, yet he liveth by
the power of God. For we also are
weak in him, but we shall live with
him by the power of God toward you.
5 a Examine yourselves, whether
ye be in the faith; prove your own
selves. Know ye not your own selves,
how that b Jesus c Christ is in you,
except ye be reprobates?
6 But I trust that ye shall know
that we are not reprobates.
7 Now I pray to God that ye do no
evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that

which is a honest, though we be as

8 For we can do nothing against
the truth, but for the truth.
9 For we are glad, when we are a weak, and ye are strong: and this
also we wish, even your perfection.
10 Therefore I write these things
being absent, lest being present I
should use sharpness, according
to the a power which the Lord hath
given me to edification, and not to
destruction.

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle
to the
Galatians
Chapter 1
Preachers of false gospels are accursed—
Paul received the gospel by revelation—
He believed, was taught, and preached
to the Gentiles.
Paul, an a apostle, (not of men,
neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ, and God the Father, who
raised him from the dead;)
2 And all the brethren which are
with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
3 Grace be to you and peace from
God the Father, and from our Lord
Jesus Christ,
4 Who a gave himself for our sins,
that he might b deliver us from this
present evil world, according to the
c will of God and our Father:
5 To whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.
6 I marvel that ye are so soon a re­ moved from him that called you
into the grace of Christ unto an­ other b gospel:
7 Which is not another; but there be
some that a trouble you, and would b pervert the c gospel of Christ.
8 But though we, or an a angel from
heaven, preach any b other c gospel
unto you than that which we have
preached unto you, let him be
d accursed.
9 As we said before, so say I now
again, If any man preach any other 
Galatians 1:10–2:6 1474
a gospel unto you than that ye have
received, let him be b accursed.
10 For do I now a persuade men, or
God? or do I seek to b please men?
for if I yet c pleased men, I should
not be the servant of Christ.
11 But I a certify you, brethren, that
the gospel which was b preached of
me is not after man.
12 For I neither received it a of man,
neither was I taught it, but b by the c revelation of Jesus Christ.
13 For ye have heard of my a conversation in time past in the Jews’
religion, how that beyond measure
I b persecuted the church of God,
and c wasted it:
14 And a profited in the Jews’ religion above many b my equals in
mine own nation, being more ex- ceedingly c zealous of the d traditions
of my fathers.
15 But when it pleased God, who
separated me from my mother’s
womb, and called me by his a grace,
16 To reveal his Son in me, that I
might preach him among the a heathen; immediately I conferred not
with b flesh and blood:
17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem
to them which were apostles before
me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
18 Then after three years I went
up to a Jerusalem to see Peter, and
abode with him fifteen days.
19 But other of the a apostles saw I
none, save b James the Lord’s c brother.
20 Now the things which I a write
unto you, behold, before God, I lie
not.
21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
22 And was unknown by face unto
the churches of Judæa which were
in Christ:
23 But they had heard only, That
he which persecuted us in times
past now preacheth the faith which
once he destroyed.
24 And they glorified God in me.
Chapter 2
Paul goes to Jerusalem—He contends
for the true gospel—Salvation comes
through Christ.
Then fourteen years after I went up
again to a Jerusalem with b Barnabas,
and took Titus with me also.
2 And I went up by a revelation, and b communicated unto them that gos- pel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which
were of reputation, lest by any means
I should run, or had run, in vain.
3 But neither Titus, who was with
me, being a Greek, was compelled
to be a circumcised:
4 a And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came
in privily to spy out our b liberty
which we have in Christ Jesus, that
they might bring us into c bondage:
5 To whom we gave place by sub- jection, no, not for an hour; that the
truth of the gospel might continue
with you.
6 But of these who seemed to be
somewhat, (whatsoever they were,
it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they

who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:
7 But contrariwise, when they saw
that the a gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as
the gospel of the b circumcision was
unto c Peter;
8 (For he that wrought effectually
in Peter to the apostleship of the
circumcision, the same was mighty
in me toward the Gentiles:)
9 And when James, a Cephas, and
John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the b grace that was given unto
me, they gave to me and Barnabas
the right hands of c fellowship; that
we should go unto the d heathen, and
they unto the circumcision.
10 Only they would that we should
remember the poor; the same which
I also was forward to do.
11 But when Peter was come to
Antioch, I withstood him to the
face, because he was to be blamed.
12 For before that certain came
from James, he did eat with the
Gentiles: but when they were come,
he withdrew and separated himself,
fearing them which were of the circumcision.
13 And the other Jews dissembled
likewise with him; insomuch that
Barnabas also was carried away
with their a dissimulation.
14 But when I saw that they walked
not uprightly according to the truth
of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew,
livest after the manner of Gentiles,
and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as
do the Jews?
15 We who are Jews by nature, and
not sinners of the Gentiles,
16 Knowing that a man is not a jus- tified by the works of the b law, but
by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we
have believed in Jesus Christ, that
we might be justified by the c faith
of Christ, and not by the d works of
the e law: for by the works of the law
shall no flesh be f justified.
17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also
are found sinners, is therefore Christ
the minister of sin? God forbid.
18 For if I build again the things
which I destroyed, I make myself a
transgressor.
19 For I through the law am a dead
to the law, that I might b live unto
God.
20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but a Christ b liveth in me: and the life which I
now live in the flesh I live by the
c faith of the Son of God, who loved
me, and gave himself for me.
21 I do not frustrate the a grace of
God: for if righteousness come by
the b law, then Christ is dead in vain.
Chapter 3
God gave the gospel to Abraham—The
Mosaic law was added because of
transgressions—The law was a schoolmaster until Christ—The Saints are
children of God by faith—All who are
of the faith and baptized into Christ
become Abraham’s seed.
O foolish Galatians, who hath
a bewitched you, that ye should not
obey the truth, before whose eyes
Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
forth, crucified among you?
2 This only would I learn of you,
Received ye the Spirit by the works
of the a law, or by the b hearing of
faith?

in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
4 Have ye suffered so many things
in vain? if it be yet in vain.
5 He therefore that a ministereth to
you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the
works of the law, or by the hearing
of faith?
6 Even as Abraham believed God,
and it was accounted to him for
a righteousness.
7 Know ye therefore that they
which are of faith, the same are the
a children of Abraham.
8 And the scripture, foreseeing
that God would justify the a heathen
through faith, preached before the
b gospel unto Abraham, saying, In
thee shall all c nations be d blessed.
9 So then they which be of faith
are a blessed with faithful Abraham.
10 For as many as are of the works
of the law are under the curse: for it
is written, a Cursed is every one that
continueth not in all things which
are written in the book of the law
to do them.
11 But that no man is justified by
the law in the sight of God, it is evi- dent: for, The just shall live by a faith.
12 And the law is not of faith: but,
The man that doeth them shall live
in them.
13 Christ hath a redeemed us from
the b curse of the c law, being made a
curse for us: for it is written, d Cursed
is every one that hangeth on a tree:
14 That the a blessing of Abraham
might come on the Gentiles through
b Jesus Christ; that we might receive
the c promise of the Spirit through
faith.
15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s
covenant, yet if it be confirmed,
no man disannulleth, or addeth
thereto.
16 Now to a Abraham and his seed
were the b promises made. He saith
not, And to seeds, as of many; but
as of one, And to thy seed, which
is Christ.
17 And this I say, that the covenant,
that was confirmed before of God
in Christ, the law, which was a four
hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make
the promise of none effect.
18 For if the a inheritance be of the
law, it is no more of promise: but
God gave it to Abraham by promise.
19 a Wherefore then serveth the law?
It was b added because of transgres- sions, till the seed should come to
whom the promise was made; and it
was ordained by angels in the hand
of a mediator.
20 Now a mediator is not a media- tor of one, but God is one.
21 Is the law then against the
promises of God? God forbid: for if
there had been a law given which
could have given life, verily righ- teousness should have been by
the law.
22 But the scripture hath concluded all under a sin, that the prom- ise by faith of Jesus Christ might be
given to them that believe.
23 But before faith came, we were
kept under the law, shut up unto
the faith which should afterwards
be revealed.
24 Wherefore the a law was our b schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,

that we might be c justified by
faith.
25 But after that faith is come, we
are no longer under a schoolmaster.
26 For ye are all the a children of
God by b faith in Christ Jesus.
27 For as many of you as have been a baptized into Christ have put on
Christ.
28 There is neither Jew nor a Greek,
there is neither bond nor free, there
is neither male nor female: for ye
are all b one in Christ Jesus.
29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are
ye a Abraham’s b seed, and c heirs according to the promise.
Chapter 4
The Saints are children of God by
adoption—Paul calls the Galatians
back to Christ—He compares the two
covenants.
Now I say, That the heir, as long as
he is a child, differeth nothing from
a servant, though he be lord of all;
2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of
the father.
3 Even so we, when we were children, were in a bondage under the
elements of the world:
4 But when the fulness of the time
was come, God a sent forth his b Son, c made of a d woman, made under
the law,
5 To a redeem them that were un- der the law, that we might receive
the b adoption of sons.
6 And because ye are sons, God
hath sent forth the Spirit of his
Son into your hearts, crying, Abba,
Father.
7 Wherefore thou art no more a a servant, but a b son; and if a son,
then an c heir of God through Christ.
8 Howbeit then, when ye knew
not God, ye a did b service unto them
which by nature are no c gods.
9 But now, after that ye have known
God, or rather are known of God,
how turn ye again to the weak and
beggarly elements, whereunto ye
desire again to be in a bondage?
10 Ye observe a days, and months,
and times, and years.
11 I am afraid a of you, lest I have
bestowed upon you labour in vain.
12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as
I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not
injured me at all.
13 Ye know how through a infirmity
of the b flesh I preached the gospel
unto you at the first.
14 And my a temptation which was
in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel
of God, even as Christ Jesus.
15 Where is then the blessedness
ye spake of? for I bear you record,
that, if it had been possible, ye would
have plucked out your own eyes,
and have given them to me.
16 Am I therefore become your en- emy, because I tell you the a truth?
17 They zealously affect you, but
not well; yea, they would exclude
you, that ye might affect them.
18 But it is good to be a zealously
affected always in a good thing, and
not only when I am present with
you.

19 My little children, of whom I
travail in birth again until Christ
be formed in you,
20 I desire to be present with you
now, and to change my voice; for I
a stand in doubt of you.
21 Tell me, ye that desire to be
under the law, do ye not hear
the law?
22 For it is written, that Abraham
had two sons, the one by a a bond- maid, the other by a freewoman.
23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but
he of the freewoman was by promise.
24 Which things are an allegory: for
these are the two covenants; the one
from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to a bondage, which is b Agar.
25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in
Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
which now is, and is in bondage
with her children.
26 But a Jerusalem which is above is
free, which is the mother of us all.
27 For it is written, a Rejoice, thou b barren that bearest not; break forth
and cry, thou that travailest not:
for the desolate hath many more
children than she which hath an
husband.
28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was,
are the a children of promise.
29 But as then he that was born
after the a flesh b persecuted him
that was born after the Spirit, even
so it is now.
30 Nevertheless what saith the
scripture? a Cast out the bondwoman
and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the
son of the freewoman.
31 So then, brethren, we are not
children of the bondwoman, but
of the free.
Chapter 5
Stand fast in gospel liberty—Seek faith,
love, Christ, and the Spirit—The works
of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit
are named.
a Stand fast therefore in the b liberty
wherewith Christ hath made us
c free, and be not d entangled again
with the yoke of e bondage.
2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that
if ye be circumcised, Christ shall
profit you nothing.
3 For I testify again to every man
that is a circumcised, that he is a
debtor to do the whole law.
4 Christ is become of no effect
unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the a law; ye are fallen from b grace.
5 For we through the Spirit wait for
the hope of righteousness by a faith.
6 For in Jesus Christ neither a circumcision b availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision; but c faith which
worketh by d love.
7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not a obey
the truth?
8 This persuasion cometh not of
him that calleth you.
9 A little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump.
10 I have a confidence in you
through the Lord, that ye b will be
none otherwise minded: but he that
c troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.

11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach
circumcision, why do I yet suffer
persecution? then is the a offence
of the cross ceased.
12 I would they were even a cut off
which b trouble you.
13 For, brethren, ye have been
called unto a liberty; only use not
liberty for an occasion to the flesh,
but by love b serve one another.
14 For all the a law is fulfilled in
one word, even in this; Thou shalt b love thy neighbour as thyself.
15 But if ye bite and devour one
another, take heed that ye be not
consumed one of another.
16 This I say then, a Walk in the b Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
c lust of the flesh.
17 For the flesh lusteth against
the a Spirit, and the Spirit against the
flesh: and these are contrary the
one to the other: so that ye cannot
do the things that ye would.
18 But if ye be a led of the Spirit,
ye are not under the b law.
19 Now the works of the a flesh are
manifest, which are these; Adultery, b fornication, c uncleanness, lasciviousness,
20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulations, wrath, a strife,
seditions, heresies,
21 a Envyings, murders, b drunken- ness, c revellings, and such like: of
the which I tell you before, as I have
also told you in time past, that they
which do such things shall not in- herit the kingdom of God.
22 But the a fruit of the b Spirit is c love, d joy, e peace, f longsuffering, g gentleness, goodness, h faith,
23 a Meekness, b temperance: against
such there is no law.
24 And they that are Christ’s have
crucified the flesh with the a affections and lusts.
25 If we live in the Spirit, let us
also walk in the Spirit.
26 Let us not be desirous of vain
glory, a provoking one another, envying one another.
Chapter 6
Bear one another’s burdens—As you
sow, so shall you reap—Be not weary
in well-doing.
Brethren, if a man be a overtaken
in a b fault, ye which are spiritual, c restore such an one in the spirit of
meekness; d considering thyself, lest
thou also be tempted.
2 Bear ye one another’s a burdens,
and so fulfil the law of Christ.
3 For if a man think himself to be
something, when he is nothing, he
deceiveth himself.
4 But let every man a prove his
own b work, and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself alone, and not
in another.
5 For every man shall a bear his
own burden.

c soweth, that shall he also d reap.
8 For he that soweth to his flesh
shall of the flesh reap corruption;
but he that soweth to the Spirit
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
9 And let us not be a weary in well
doing: for in due season we shall
b reap, if we faint not.
10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do a good unto all men,
especially unto them who are of the
household of faith.
11 Ye see how large a letter I have
written unto you with mine own
hand.
12 As many as desire to make a
fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only
lest they should suffer a persecution
for the cross of Christ.
13 For neither they themselves
who are circumcised keep the law;
but desire to have you circumcised,
that they may glory in your flesh.
14 But God forbid that I should
glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.
15 For in Christ Jesus neither a circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature.
16 And as many as walk according
to this rule, a peace be on them, and
mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
17 From henceforth let no man
trouble me: for I bear in my body
the marks of the Lord Jesus.
18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle
to the
Ephesians
Chapter 1
The Saints are foreordained to receive
the gospel—The gospel is to be restored
in the latter days—The Saints are sealed
by the Holy Spirit of Promise—They
know God and Christ by revelation.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
by the will of God, to the a saints
which are at Ephesus, and to
the faithful in Christ Jesus:
2 Grace be to you, and peace, from
God our Father, and from the Lord
Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
blessed us with all a spiritual bless­ ings in heavenly places in Christ:
4 According as he hath a chosen us
in him b before the foundation of the
world, that we should be c holy and
without blame before him in love:
1481 Ephesians 1:5–23
5 Having a predestinated us unto
the b adoption of children by Jesus
Christ to himself, according to the
good pleasure of his will,
6 To the praise of the glory of his
grace, wherein he hath made us
accepted in the beloved.
7 In whom we have a redemption
through his blood, the b forgiveness
of sins, according to the c riches of
his d grace;
8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all a wisdom and b prudence;
9 Having made known unto us the a mystery of his b will, according to
his good pleasure which he hath
purposed in himself:
10 That in the a dispensation of the
fulness of times he might b gather
together in one c all things in Christ,
both which are in heaven, and which
are on earth; even in him:
11 In whom also we have obtained
an inheritance, being a predestinated
according to the purpose of him who
worketh all things after the counsel
of his own will:
12 That we should be to the praise
of his glory, who a first trusted in
Christ.
13 In whom ye also trusted, after
that ye heard the word of truth,
the a gospel of your salvation: in
whom also after that ye believed, ye
were b sealed with that holy Spirit
of c promise,
14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of
the purchased possession, unto the
praise of his glory.
15 Wherefore I also, after I heard
of your a faith in the Lord Jesus, and
love unto all the saints,
16 Cease not to give thanks for
you, making mention of you in my
prayers;
17 That the God of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of glory, may
give unto you the spirit of a wisdom
and b revelation in the knowledge
of him:
18 The eyes of your a understanding being b enlightened; that ye may
know what is the hope of his calling,
and what the c riches of the glory of
his d inheritance in the saints,
19 And what is the exceeding great- ness of his a power to us-ward who
believe, according to the working
of his mighty power,
20 Which he wrought in Christ,
when he a raised him from the dead,
and set him at his own right hand
in the b heavenly places,
21 Far above all principality, and
power, and might, and dominion,
and every a name that is named, not
only in this world, but also in that
which is to come:
22 And hath put a all things under
his b feet, and gave him to be the c head over all things to the d church,
23 Which is his body, the fulness
of him that filleth all in all.

Ephesians 2:1–22 1482
And you hath he quickened, who were a dead in trespasses and sins;
2 Wherein in time past ye walked
according to the course of this
a world, according to the prince of
the power of the air, the spirit that
now worketh in the children of
b disobedience:
3 Among whom also we all had
our conversation in times past in
the a lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the
desires of the flesh and of the mind;
and were by b nature the children
of wrath, even as others.
4 But God, who is rich in a mercy,
for his great love wherewith he
loved us,
5 Even when we were dead in sins,
hath a quickened us together with
Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
6 And hath raised us up together,
and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
7 That in the ages to come he
might shew the exceeding a riches
of his grace in his kindness toward
us through Christ Jesus.
8 For by a grace are ye b saved
through c faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the d gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should a boast.
10 For we are his a workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus unto good
b works, which God hath before or- dained that we should c walk in them.
11 Wherefore remember, that ye be- ing in time past Gentiles in the flesh,
who are called a Uncircumcision by
that which is called the Circumcision
in the flesh made by hands;
12 That at that time ye were
without Christ, being aliens from
the commonwealth of Israel, and
a strangers from the b covenants of
promise, having no c hope, and d without God in the world:
13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who
sometimes were far off are made
nigh by the blood of Christ.
14 For he is our a peace, who hath
made both one, and hath broken
down the middle b wall of partition
between us;
15 Having a abolished in his flesh
the enmity, even the law of com- mandments contained in b ordinances;
for to make in himself of twain one
c new man, so making peace;
16 And that he might a reconcile
both unto God in one body by
the cross, having slain the enmity
thereby:
17 And came and preached peace

Chapter 3
The Gentiles are fellow heirs with Israel—The love of Christ surpasses all
understanding.
For this cause I Paul, the prisoner
of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
2 If ye have heard of the a dispensation of the grace of God which is
given me to you-ward:
3 How that by revelation he made a known unto me the mystery; (as I
b wrote afore in few words,
4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may
understand my knowledge in the
a mystery of Christ)
5 Which in other ages was not
made known unto the sons of men,
as it is now a revealed unto his holy
apostles and b prophets by the Spirit;
6 That the a Gentiles should be fel- lowheirs, and of the same body, and
partakers of his promise in Christ
by the gospel:
7 Whereof I was made a minister,
according to the gift of the grace of
God given unto me by the effectual
working of his power.
8 Unto me, who am less than the
least of all saints, is this a grace given,
that I should preach among the
Gentiles the unsearchable b riches
of Christ;
9 And to make all men see what
is the fellowship of the a mystery,
which from the beginning of the
world hath been hid in God, who
b created all things by c Jesus Christ:
10 To the intent that now unto the
principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the
church the manifold wisdom of God,
11 According to the eternal a purpose which he purposed in Christ
Jesus our Lord:
12 In whom we have boldness and
access with confidence by the faith
of him.
13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint
not at my tribulations for you, which
is your glory.
14 For this cause I bow my knees
unto the a Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ,
15 Of whom the whole a family in
heaven and earth is named,
16 That he would grant you, ac- cording to the a riches of his glory,
to be b strengthened with might by
his Spirit in the inner man;
17 That Christ may dwell in your
hearts by faith; that ye, being a rooted
and b grounded in love,
18 May be able to comprehend
with all saints what is the breadth,
and length, and depth, and height;
19 And to know the a love of Christ,
which passeth knowledge, that ye
might be filled with all the fulness
of God.
20 Now unto him that is able to
do exceeding abundantly above all
that we ask or think, according to
the power that worketh in us,
21 Unto him be glory in the church
by Christ Jesus throughout all ages,
a world without end. Amen.
Chapter 4
There is one Lord, one faith, and one
baptism—Apostles and prophets are
essential to the Church—The Saints
are exhorted to live righteously—They
are sealed unto the day of redemption.
I therefore, the prisoner of the
Lord, beseech you that ye walk
a worthy of the b vocation wherewith
ye are called,
2 With all lowliness and meekness,
with longsuffering, a forbearing one
another in love;

3 Endeavouring to keep the a unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
4 There is one a body, and one Spirit,
even as ye are called in one hope of
your calling;
5 One Lord, one a faith, one b baptism,
6 One God and a Father of all, who
is above all, and through all, and
in you all.
7 But unto every one of us is given a grace according to the measure of
the gift of Christ.
8 Wherefore he saith, When he a ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
men.
9 (Now that he ascended, what is
it but that he also descended first
into the lower parts of the earth?
10 He that descended is the same
also that a ascended up far above
all heavens, that he might fill all
things.)
11 And he a gave some, b apostles;
and some, c prophets; and some, d evangelists; and some, e pastors and
f teachers;
12 For the a perfecting of the saints,
for the work of the ministry, for
the b edifying of the body of Christ:
13 Till we all come in the a unity
of the faith, and of the b knowledge
of the Son of God, unto a c perfect
man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
14 That we henceforth be no more a children, tossed to and fro, and
carried about with every wind of
b doctrine, by the sleight of men,
and cunning craftiness, whereby
they lie in wait to deceive;
15 But speaking the a truth in love,
may grow up into him in all things,
which is the b head, even Christ:
16 From whom the whole body fitly
joined together and compacted by
that which every joint supplieth,
according to the effectual working
in the measure of every part, mak- eth increase of the body unto the
edifying of itself in love.
17 This I say therefore, and testify
in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk
not as other a Gentiles walk, in the b vanity of their c mind,
18 Having the a understanding
darkened, being alienated from
the life of God through the b igno- rance that is in them, because of the
c blindness of their d heart:
19 Who being a past b feeling have
given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness
with greediness.
20 But ye have not so learned
Christ;
21 If so be that ye have heard him,
and have been taught by him, as the
truth is in Jesus:
22 That ye a put off concerning the
former conversation the b old man,
which is corrupt according to the
deceitful c lusts;
23 And be renewed in the spirit
of your mind;

Chapter 5
The Saints are exhorted to avoid uncleanness and walk uprightly—Husbands and wives should love each other.
Be ye therefore a followers of God,
as dear children;
2 And a walk in love, as Christ also
hath loved us, and hath given him- self for us an b offering and a c sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling
d savour.
3 But a fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
not be once named among you, as
becometh b saints;
4 Neither a filthiness, nor b foolish c talking, nor jesting, which are not
convenient: but rather giving of
thanks.
5 For this ye know, that no a whore- monger, nor b unclean person, nor
covetous man, who is an idolater,
hath any c inheritance in the king- dom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no man a deceive you with
vain words: for because of these
things cometh the b wrath of God
upon the children of c disobedience.
7 Be not ye therefore partakers
with them.
8 For ye were sometimes darkness,
but now are ye light in the Lord:
walk as a children of b light:
9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in
all a goodness and righteousness
and truth;)
10 Proving what is acceptable unto
the Lord.
11 And have no a fellowship with
the unfruitful works of b darkness,
but rather c reprove them.

12 For it is a a shame even to speak
of those things which are done of
them in secret.
13 But all things that are reproved
are made manifest by the light: for
whatsoever doth make manifest is
light.
14 Wherefore he saith, Awake
thou that sleepest, and arise from
the dead, and Christ shall give thee
a light.
15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
16 Redeeming the time, because
the days are evil.
17 Wherefore be ye not a unwise,
but understanding what the will of
the Lord is.
18 And be not a drunk with wine,
wherein is b excess; but be filled
with the Spirit;
19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms
and a hymns and spiritual songs,
singing and making b melody in your
heart to the Lord;
20 Giving a thanks always for all
things unto God and the Father in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
21 a Submitting yourselves one to
another in the fear of God.
22 a Wives, b submit yourselves unto
your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
23 For the a husband is the head of
the wife, even as Christ is the b head
of the c church: and he is the saviour
of the body.
24 Therefore as the church is sub- ject unto Christ, so let the wives be to
their own husbands in every thing.
25 a Husbands, b love your c wives,
even as Christ also loved the church,
and gave himself for it;
26 That he might a sanctify and b cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;
but that it should be holy and with- out blemish.
28 So ought men to love their wives
as their own bodies. He that loveth
his a wife loveth himself.
29 For no man ever yet a hated
his own b flesh; but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, even as the Lord the
church:
30 For we are a members of his
body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
31 For this cause shall a man leave
his father and mother, and shall be
joined unto his wife, and they two
shall be a one flesh.
32 This is a great a mystery: but I
speak concerning Christ and the
church.
33 Nevertheless let every one of
you in particular so love his wife
even as himself; and the a wife see
that she b reverence her husband.

them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
5 a Servants, be obedient to them
that are your b masters according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling,
in singleness of your heart, as unto
Christ;
6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the a servants of
Christ, doing the b will of God from
the heart;
7 With good will doing a service, as
to the Lord, and not to men:
8 Knowing that whatsoever good
thing any man doeth, the same shall
he a receive of the Lord, whether he
be bond or free.
9 And, ye a masters, do the same
things unto them, forbearing threat- ening: knowing that your b Master
also is in heaven; neither is there
c respect of persons with him.
10 Finally, my brethren, be a strong
in the Lord, and in the power of
his might.
11 Put on the whole a armour of
God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.
12 For we a wrestle not b against c flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
the d rulers of the e darkness of this
world, against spiritual f wickedness
in high places.
13 Wherefore take unto you the
whole armour of God, that ye may
be able to withstand in the evil day,
and having done all, to stand.
14 Stand therefore, having your
loins a girt about with b truth, and
having on the c breastplate of d righteousness;
15 And your feet shod with the
preparation of the gospel of a peace;
16 Above all, taking the shield of a faith, wherewith ye shall be able
to quench all the fiery b darts of the
wicked.
17 And take the helmet of a salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God:
18 a Praying always with all prayer
and supplication in the Spirit, and
watching thereunto with all b perseverance and supplication for all
saints;
19 And for me, that utterance may
be given unto me, that I may open
my mouth boldly, to make known
the a mystery of the gospel,
20 For which I am an ambassador
in bonds: that therein I may speak
a boldly, as I ought to speak.
21 But that ye also may know my
affairs, and how I do, a Tychicus, a
beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known
to you all things:
22 Whom I have sent unto you for
the same purpose, that ye might
know our affairs, and that he might
comfort your hearts.
23 Peace be to the brethren, and
love with faith, from God the Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
24 Grace be with all them that love
our Lord Jesus Christ in a sincerity.
Amen.

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle
to the
Philippians
Chapter 1
All that happened to Paul furthered the
gospel cause—Our conduct should be
worthy of the gospel.
Paul and Timotheus, the a servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
saints in Christ Jesus which are
at Philippi, with the b bishops and c deacons:
2 Grace be unto you, and peace,
from God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.
3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
4 Always in every prayer of mine
for you all making request with joy,
5 For your fellowship in the gospel
from the first day until now;
6 Being confident of this very
thing, that he which hath begun a
good work in you will a perform it
until the day of Jesus Christ:
7 Even as it is a meet for me to think
this of you all, because I have you
in my heart; inasmuch as both in
my bonds, and in the defence and
b confirmation of the gospel, ye all
are partakers of my c grace.
8 For God is my a record, how
greatly I long after you all in the
b bowels of Jesus Christ.
9 And this I pray, that your a love
may abound yet more and more
in knowledge and in all judgment;
10 That ye may a approve things
that are excellent; that ye may be
b sincere and without offence till
the day of Christ;
11 Being filled with the fruits of a righteousness, which are by Jesus
Christ, unto the glory and praise
of God.
12 But I would ye should under­ stand, brethren, that the things
which happened unto me have a fallen
out rather unto the furtherance of
the gospel;
13 So that my bonds in Christ are
manifest in all the a palace, and in
all other places;
14 And many of the brethren in
the Lord, waxing confident by my
bonds, are much more bold to speak
the word without a fear.
15 Some indeed preach Christ even
of envy and a strife; and some also
of good will:
16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to
add affliction to my bonds:
17 But the other of love, knowing
that I am set for the defence of the
gospel.
18 What then? notwithstanding,
every way, whether in pretence, or
in truth, Christ is preached; and
I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
rejoice.
19 For I know that this shall turn to
my salvation through your a prayer,
and the supply of the b Spirit of
Jesus Christ,
20 According to my earnest 
1489 Philippians 1:21–2:10
expectation and my a hope, that in
nothing I shall be ashamed, but that
with all boldness, as always, so now
also Christ shall be b magnified in
my body, whether it be by life, or
by death.
21 For to me to live is Christ, and
to die is gain.
22 But if I live in the flesh, this is
the fruit of my labour: yet what I
shall choose I a wot not.
23 For I am a in a strait betwixt two,
having a desire to depart, and to
be with Christ; which is far better:
24 Nevertheless to a abide in the
flesh is more needful for you.
25 And having this confidence, I
know that I shall abide and continue
with you all for your furtherance
and joy of faith;
26 That your rejoicing may be more
abundant in Jesus Christ for me by
my coming to you again.
27 Only let your conversation be
as it becometh the gospel of Christ:
that whether I come and see you, or
else be absent, I may hear of your
affairs, that ye a stand fast in one
spirit, with b one c mind d striving
together for the faith of the gospel;
28 And in nothing terrified by your
adversaries: a which is to them an
evident token of perdition, but to
you of salvation, and that of God.
29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on
him, but also to a suffer for his sake;
30 Having the same conflict which
ye saw in me, and now hear to be
in me.
Chapter 2
Saints should be of one mind and one
spirit—Every knee will bow to Christ—
Saints must work out their salvation—
Paul faces martyrdom with joy.
If there be therefore any consolation
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if
any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
a bowels and mercies,
2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like- minded, having the same a love, being
of b one c accord, of one mind.
3 Let nothing be done through a strife
or vainglory; but in lowliness of
mind let each b esteem other better
than themselves.
4 Look not every man on his own
things, but every man also on the
things of others.
5 Let this mind be in you, which
was also in Christ Jesus:
6 Who, being in the a form of God,
thought it not robbery to be b equal
with God:
7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
of a a servant, and was made in the
likeness of men:
8 And being found in a fashion as
a man, he b humbled himself, and
became c obedient unto d death, even
the e death of the cross.
9 Wherefore God also hath highly a exalted him, and given him a b name
which is above every name:
10 That at the a name of Jesus ev- ery b knee should bow, of things in
heaven, and things in earth, and
things under the earth;

11 And that every tongue should
confess that Jesus Christ is a Lord, to
the glory of God the Father.
12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye
have always obeyed, not as in my
presence only, but now much more
in my absence, a work out your own b salvation with fear and trembling.
13 For it is God which worketh
in you both to will and to do of his
good pleasure.
14 Do all things without murmurings and a disputings:
15 That ye may be blameless and
harmless, the a sons of God, without
rebuke, in the midst of a crooked
and perverse b nation, among whom
ye c shine as lights in the world;
16 Holding forth the word of life;
that I may rejoice in the day of
Christ, that I have not run in vain,
neither laboured in vain.
17 Yea, and if I be a offered upon
the sacrifice and service of your
faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
18 For the same cause also do ye
joy, and rejoice with me.
19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to
send Timotheus shortly unto you,
that I also may be of good comfort,
when I know your state.
20 For I have no man likeminded,
who will naturally care for your
state.
21 For all a seek their b own, not
the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
22 But ye know the a proof of him,
that, as a son with the father, he
hath served with me in the gospel.
23 Him therefore I hope to send
presently, so soon as I shall see how
it will go with me.
24 But I trust in the Lord that I also
myself shall come shortly.
25 Yet I supposed it necessary
to send to you a Epaphroditus, my
brother, and companion in labour,
and fellowsoldier, but your mes- senger, and he that ministered to
my wants.
26 For he longed after you all, and
was full of heaviness, because that
ye had heard that he had been sick.
27 For indeed he was sick nigh
unto death: but God had mercy on
him; and not on him only, but on
me also, lest I should have sorrow
upon sorrow.
28 I sent him therefore the more
carefully, that, when ye see him
again, ye may rejoice, and that I
may be the less sorrowful.
29 Receive him therefore in the
Lord with all a gladness; and b hold
such in c reputation:
30 Because for the work of Christ
he was nigh unto death, not regard- ing his life, to supply your a lack of
service toward me.
Chapter 3
Paul sacrifices all things for Christ—
True ministers set examples of righ- teousness.
Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the
Lord. To write the same things to
you, to me indeed is not grievous,
but for you it is safe.
2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil
workers, beware of the concision.
3 For we are the a circumcision,
which b worship God in the spirit,
and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have
no confidence in the c flesh.
4 Though I might also have con- fidence in the flesh. If any other
man thinketh that he hath whereof
he might trust in the flesh, I more:

church; touching the righteousness
which is in the law, blameless.
7 But what things were gain to
me, those I counted loss for Christ.
8 Yea doubtless, and I count all
things but loss for the excellency of
the knowledge of Christ Jesus my
Lord: for whom I have a suffered the b loss of all things, and do count them
but c dung, that I may win Christ,
9 And be found in him, not having
mine own righteousness, which is of
the law, but that which is through
the faith of Christ, the a righteousness which is of God by faith:
10 That I may know him, and the
power of his resurrection, and the
a fellowship of his sufferings, being
made conformable unto his death;
11 If by any means I might attain
unto the resurrection of the a dead.
12 Not as though I had already
attained, either were already a perfect: but I b follow after, if that I may
apprehend that for which also I am
apprehended of Christ Jesus.
13 Brethren, I count not myself to
have apprehended: but this one thing
I do, forgetting those things which
are behind, and reaching forth unto
those things which are before,
14 I a press toward the mark for the b prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus.
15 Let us therefore, as many as be a perfect, be thus minded: and if in
any thing ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you.
16 Nevertheless, whereto we have
already attained, let us walk by the
same rule, let us mind the same
thing.
17 Brethren, be a followers together
of me, and mark them which walk
so as ye have us for an b ensample.
18 (For many walk, of whom I
have told you often, and now tell
you even weeping, that they are the
enemies of the cross of Christ:
19 Whose a end is destruction,
whose God is their belly, b and whose
glory is in their c shame, who mind
earthly things.)
20 For our conversation is in
heaven; from whence also we look for
the a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
21 Who shall a change our b vile
body, c that it may be fashioned like
unto his glorious d body, according
to the working whereby he is able
even to e subdue all things unto
himself.
Chapter 4
Stand fast in the Lord—We believe in
being honest, true, and chaste.
Therefore, my brethren dearly
beloved and longed for, my joy and
crown, so a stand fast in the Lord, my
dearly beloved.
2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech
Syntyche, that they be of the same
mind in the Lord.
3 And I entreat thee also, true a yokefellow, help those women
which laboured with me in the
gospel, with Clement also, and with
other my fellowlabourers, whose
names are in the b book of life.
4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and
again I say, Rejoice.

every thing by c prayer and supplication with d thanksgiving let
your requests be made known unto
God.
7 And the a peace of God, which
passeth all b understanding, shall c keep your hearts and minds through
Christ Jesus.
8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever
things are a true, whatsoever things
are b honest, whatsoever things are c just, whatsoever things are d pure,
whatsoever things are e lovely, f what- soever things are of good report; if
there be any g virtue, and if there be

9 Those things, which ye have both
learned, and a received, and heard,
and seen in me, do: and the God of
peace shall be with you.
10 But I rejoiced in the Lord
greatly, that now at the last your
a care of me hath flourished again;
wherein ye were also careful, but
ye b lacked opportunity.
11 Not that I speak in respect of
want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be a content.
12 I know both how to be a abased,
and I know how to abound: every
where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry, both to abound and to suffer
need.
13 I can do all things through a Christ which b strengtheneth me.
14 Notwithstanding ye have well
done, that ye did a communicate
with my affliction.
15 Now ye Philippians know also,
that in the beginning of the gospel,
when I departed from Macedonia,
no church communicated with me
as concerning giving and receiving,
but ye only.
16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent
once and again unto my necessity.
17 Not because I desire a gift: but
I desire a fruit that may abound to
your account.
18 But I have all, and a abound:
I am full, having received of b Ep- aphroditus the things which were
sent from you, an odour of a sweet
smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
19 But my God shall supply all
your a need according to his b riches
in glory by Christ Jesus.
20 Now unto God and our Father
be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
21 Salute every saint in Christ
Jesus. The brethren which are with
me greet you.
22 All the saints salute you, chiefly
they that are of a Cæsar’s household.
23 The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all. Amen.

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle
to the
Colossians
Chapter 1
Redemption comes through Christ—He
created all things, is in the image of
God, and is the Firstborn of the Father.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,
2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse:
Grace be unto you, and peace, from
God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
3 We give thanks to God and the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
praying always for you,
4 Since we heard of your a faith in
Christ Jesus, and of the b love which
ye have to all the saints,
5 For the a hope which is laid up
for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
before in the word of the truth of
the b gospel;
6 Which is come unto you, a as it is
in all the world; and bringeth forth
b fruit, as it doth also in you, since
the day ye heard of it, and knew the c grace of God in truth:
7 As ye also learned of a Epaphras
our dear fellowservant, who is for
you a faithful minister of Christ;
8 Who also declared unto us your
love in the Spirit.
9 For this cause we also, since the
day we heard it, do not cease to pray
for you, and to desire that ye might
be filled with the a knowledge of his b will in all wisdom and spiritual
c understanding;
10 That ye might a walk b worthy of
the Lord unto all c pleasing, being
fruitful in every good work, and
increasing in the d knowledge of
God;
11 a Strengthened with all might,
according to his b glorious c power,
unto all patience and longsuffering
with d joyfulness;
12 Giving a thanks unto the Father,
which hath b made us meet to be
partakers of the c inheritance of the
saints in light:
13 Who hath delivered us from
the power of a darkness, and hath
translated us into the b kingdom of
his dear c Son:
14 In whom we have a redemption
through his blood, even the b forgiveness of sins:
15 Who is the a image of the invisible b God, the c firstborn of d every
creature:
Colossians 1:16–2:3 1494
16 For by him were all a things b created, that are in heaven, and that
are in earth, visible and invisible,
whether they be thrones, or domin- ions, or c principalities, or powers:
all things were d created by him,
and for him:
17 And he is before all things, and
by him all things a consist.
18 And he is the a head of the body,
the church: who is the beginning,
the b firstborn from the dead; that
in all things he might have the preeminence.
19 For it pleased the Father that in
him should all a fulness dwell;
20 And, having made peace through
the blood of his cross, by him to
a reconcile all things unto himself;
by him, I say, whether they be things
in earth, or things in heaven.
21 And you, that were a sometime b alienated and enemies in your mind
by wicked works, yet now hath he
reconciled
22 In the body of his flesh through a death, to present you holy and
b unblameable and unreproveable
in his sight:
23 If ye a continue in the faith b grounded and settled, and be not c moved away from the d hope of the
gospel, which ye have heard, and
which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof
I Paul am made a minister;
24 Who now rejoice in my suf- ferings for you, and fill up that
which is behind of the a afflictions
of Christ in my flesh for his body’s
sake, which is the church:
25 Whereof I am made a minister,
according to the a dispensation of
God which is given to me for you,
to fulfil the word of God;
26 Even the a mystery which hath
been hid from ages and from gen- erations, but now is made b manifest
to his saints:
27 To whom God would make a known what is the b riches of the
glory of this mystery among the
Gentiles; which is Christ in you,
the hope of glory:
28 Whom we a preach, b warning
every man, and teaching every man
in all wisdom; that we may present
every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which
worketh in me mightily.
Chapter 2
The fulness of the Godhead dwells in
Christ—Beware of being deceived by
the traditions of men—The handwriting against us was nailed to the cross
of Christ.
For I would that ye knew what great a conflict I have for you, and for them
at b Laodicea, and for as many as
have not seen my face in the flesh;
2 That their hearts might be com- forted, being knit together in love,
and unto all riches of the full assurance of a understanding, to the
acknowledgement of the mystery
of God, b and of the Father, and of
Christ;

4 And this I say, lest any man
should beguile you with enticing
words.
5 For though I be absent in the
flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
joying and beholding your a order,
and the steadfastness of your faith
in Christ.
6 As ye have therefore received
Christ Jesus the Lord, so a walk ye
in him:
7 a Rooted and built up in him, and
stablished in the faith, as ye have
been taught, abounding therein
with b thanksgiving.
8 Beware lest any man a spoil you
through b philosophy and vain c deceit, after the d tradition of men,
after the rudiments of the e world,
and not after Christ.
9 For in him dwelleth all the a ful- ness of the Godhead bodily.
10 And ye are a complete in him,
which is the head of all b principal- ity and power:
11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the a circumcision made
without hands, in putting off the
b body of the sins of the flesh by the
circumcision of Christ:
12 a Buried with him in b baptism,
wherein also ye are c risen with him
through the faith of the d operation
of God, who hath raised him from
the dead.
13 And you, being dead in your
sins and the uncircumcision of your
flesh, hath he a quickened together
with him, having forgiven you all
trespasses;
14 a Blotting out the handwriting
of ordinances that was against us,
which was contrary to us, and took
it out of the way, nailing it to his
cross;
15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew
of them openly, triumphing over
them in it.
16 Let no man therefore a judge you
in b meat, or in drink, or in respect
of an holyday, or of the new moon,
or of the c sabbath days:
17 Which are a a shadow of things
to come; but the body is of Christ.
18 Let no man a beguile you of
your reward in a voluntary b humility and worshipping of angels,
intruding into those things which
he hath not seen, vainly puffed up
by his fleshly mind,
19 And not holding the a Head, from
which all the body by joints and
bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth
with the increase of God.
20 Wherefore if ye be a dead with
Christ from the rudiments of the
world, why, as though living in the
world, are ye subject to b ordinances,
21 a (Touch not; taste not; handle
not;
22 Which all are to perish with the
using;) after the a commandments
and b doctrines of men?
23 Which things have indeed a
shew of wisdom in will worship,
and humility, and neglecting of
the body; not in any honour to the
satisfying of the flesh.

Chapter 3
Some lives are hidden with God in
Christ—The Saints are told to be holy
and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.
If ye then be a risen with Christ,
seek those things which are above,
where Christ sitteth on the right
hand of God.
2 Set your a affection on b things c above, not on things on the d earth.
3 For ye are a dead, and your life
is hid with Christ in God.
4 When Christ, who is our a life, shall b appear, then shall ye also appear
with him in c glory.
5 a Mortify therefore your b members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, c inordinate
affection, evil concupiscence, and
d covetousness, which is e idolatry:
6 For which things’ sake the a wrath
of God cometh on the children of
b disobedience:
7 In the which ye also walked a some
time, when ye lived in them.
8 But now ye also a put off all these; b anger, wrath, c malice, d blasphemy,
filthy e communication out of your
mouth.
9 a Lie not one to another, seeing
that ye have put off the b old man
with his deeds;
10 And have put on the a new man,
which is renewed in knowledge after
the b image of him that c created him:
11 Where there is neither a Greek
nor Jew, b circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian,
bond nor free: but Christ is all, and
in all.
12 Put on therefore, as the a elect
of God, holy and beloved, b bowels of c mercies, d kindness, e humbleness
of mind, f meekness, longsuffering;
13 a Forbearing one another, and b forgiving one another, if any man
have a quarrel against any: even as
Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
14 And above all these things put
on a charity, which is the bond of
perfectness.
15 And let the a peace of God rule
in your hearts, to the which also ye
are called in one body; and be ye
b thankful.
16 Let the a word of Christ dwell in
you richly in all b wisdom; c teaching
and admonishing one another in
psalms and d hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with grace in your
hearts to the Lord.
17 And whatsoever ye do in word
or deed, a do all in the name of the
Lord Jesus, giving b thanks to God
and the Father by him.
18 a Wives, submit yourselves unto
your own husbands, as it is fit in
the Lord.
19 a Husbands, b love your wives, and
be not bitter against them.
20 a Children, b obey your parents in

unto the Lord.
21 a Fathers, b provoke not your
children to c anger, lest they be discouraged.
22 a Servants, obey in all things your
masters according to the flesh; not
with eyeservice, as menpleasers;
but in b singleness of heart, c fearing
God:
23 And whatsoever ye do, do it a heartily, as to the Lord, and not
unto men;

shall a receive the b reward of the c inheritance: for ye d serve the Lord

2 Continue in prayer, and watch in
the same with thanksgiving;
3 Withal praying also for us, that
God would open unto us a a door of
utterance, to speak the mystery of
Christ, for which I am also in bonds:
4 That I may make it manifest, as
I ought to speak.
5 a Walk in b wisdom toward them
that are without, redeeming the

grace, seasoned with b salt, that ye
may know how ye ought to answer

hearts;

These only are my fellowworkers
unto the kingdom of God, which
have been a comfort unto me.
12 a Epaphras, who is one of you,

The First Epistle of
Paul the Apostle to the
Thessalonians
Chapter 1
The gospel comes both in word and in
power.
Paul, and a Silvanus, and b Timo­ theus, c unto the d church of the e Thessalonians which is in God
the Father and in the Lord Jesus
Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace,
from God our Father, and the Lord
Jesus Christ.
2 We give a thanks to God always
for you all, making mention of you
in our prayers;
3 Remembering without ceasing
your work of a faith, and b labour of
love, and c patience of hope in our
Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of
God and our Father;
4 Knowing, brethren a beloved, your b election of God.
5 For our a gospel b came not unto
you in c word only, but also in d power,
and in the e Holy Ghost, and in much
assurance; as ye know what f man­ ner of men we were among you for
your sake.
6 And ye became a followers of us,
and of the Lord, having received the
word in much b affliction, with c joy
of the Holy Ghost:
7 So that ye were a ensamples to
all that believe in Macedonia and
Achaia.
8 For from you sounded out the
word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every
a place your faith to God-ward is
spread abroad; so that we need not
to speak any thing.
9 For they themselves shew of us
what manner of entering in we had 
1499 1 Thessalonians 1:10–2:16
unto you, and how ye turned to God
from a idols to serve the b living and
true God;
10 And to wait for his Son from a heaven, whom he raised from the
dead, even Jesus, which b delivered
us from the c wrath to come.
Chapter 2
True ministers preach in a godly manner—Converts are the glory and joy of
missionaries.
For yourselves, brethren, know our a entrance in unto you, that it was
not in vain:
2 But even after that we had suf- fered before, and were shamefully
a entreated, as ye know, at Philippi,
we were bold in our God to b speak
unto you the gospel of God with
much contention.
3 For our exhortation was not of a deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
b guile:
4 But as we were a allowed of God
to be b put in c trust with the gospel,
even so we d speak; not as e pleasing
men, but God, which f trieth our
hearts.
5 For neither at any time used
we a flattering words, as ye know,
nor a cloak of b covetousness; God
is witness:
6 Nor of men sought we a glory, nei- ther of you, nor yet of others, when
we might have been burdensome,
as the apostles of Christ.
7 But we were gentle among you,
even as a nurse cherisheth her
children:
8 So being affectionately desirous
of you, we were willing to have im- parted unto you, not the gospel of
God only, but also our own a souls,
because ye were dear unto us.
9 For ye remember, brethren, our
labour and a travail: for b labouring
night and day, because we would
not be c chargeable unto any of you,
we preached unto you the gospel
of God.
10 Ye are a witnesses, and God also,
how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among
you that believe:
11 As ye know how we exhorted
and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his a children,
12 That ye would a walk b worthy
of God, who hath called you unto
his kingdom and glory.
13 For this cause also a thank we
God without ceasing, because, when
ye received the word of God which
ye heard of us, ye received it not as
the word of men, but as it is in truth,
the word of God, which effectually
worketh also in you that believe.
14 For ye, brethren, became a fol- lowers of the churches of God which
in Judæa are in Christ Jesus: for ye
also have b suffered like things of
your own countrymen, even as they
have of the Jews:
15 Who both a killed the Lord Jesus,
and their own prophets, and have
persecuted us; and they please not
God, and are contrary to all men:

Gentiles that they might be saved,

to fill up their sins b alway: for the
wrath is come upon them to the
uttermost.
17 But we, brethren, being taken
from you for a short time in pres- ence, not in heart, endeavoured the
more abundantly to see your a face
with great desire.
18 Wherefore we would have come
unto you, even I Paul, once and
again; but Satan hindered us.
19 For what is our hope, or joy, or
crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye
in the presence of our Lord Jesus
Christ at his a coming?
20 For ye are our glory and joy.
Chapter 3
The Saints are told to perfect that which
is lacking in their faith.
Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to
be left at a Athens alone;
2 And sent a Timotheus, our brother,
and minister of God, and our fellow- labourer in the gospel of Christ, to
b establish you, and to comfort you
concerning your faith:
3 That no man should be a moved
by these b afflictions: for yourselves
know that we are c appointed thereunto.
4 For verily, when we were with
you, we told you before that we
should suffer tribulation; even as
it came to pass, and ye know.
5 For this cause, when I could
no longer forbear, I sent to know
your faith, lest by some means the
a tempter have b tempted you, and
our labour be in vain.
6 But now when Timotheus came
from you unto us, and brought us
good tidings of your faith and char- ity, and that ye have good remem- brance of us always, desiring greatly
to see us, as we also to see you:
7 Therefore, brethren, we were a comforted over you in all our b affliction and distress by your faith:
8 For now we live, if ye stand fast
in the Lord.
9 For what thanks can we render
to God again for you, for all the a joy
wherewith we joy for your sakes
before our God;
10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your a face,
and might b perfect that which is
lacking in your faith?
11 Now God himself and our
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
direct our way unto you.
12 And the Lord make you to in- crease and a abound in b love one toward another, and toward all men,
even as we do toward you:
13 To the end he may stablish your
hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the
a coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
with all his b saints.
Chapter 4
The Saints are told to be holy, sanctify
themselves, and love one another—The
Lord will come, and the dead will rise.
Furthermore then we beseech you,
brethren, and exhort you by the Lord
Jesus, that as ye have a received of
us how ye ought to b walk and to c please God, so ye would d abound
more and more.
2 For ye know what commandments a we gave you by the Lord
Jesus.

3 For this is the will of God, even
your a sanctification, that ye should b abstain from c fornication:
4 That every one of you should
know how to possess his a vessel in b sanctification and honour;
5 Not in the a lust of concupiscence,
even as the b Gentiles which c know
not God:
6 That no man a go beyond and defraud his brother in b any matter: be- cause that the Lord is the c avenger of
all such, as we also have forewarned
you and testified.
7 For God hath not called us unto a uncleanness, but unto holiness.
8 He therefore that a despiseth, b despiseth not man, but God, who hath
also given unto us his c holy Spirit.
9 But as touching a brotherly love
ye need not that I write unto you:
for ye yourselves are b taught of God
to c love one another.
10 And indeed ye do it toward all
the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren,
that ye increase more and more;
11 And that ye a study to be quiet,
and to do your own business, and
to b work with your own c hands, as
we commanded you;
12 That ye may walk a honestly
toward them that are without, and
that ye may have lack of nothing.
13 But I would not have you to
be ignorant, brethren, concerning
them which are asleep, that ye a sorrow not, even as others which have
no b hope.
14 For if we believe that Jesus
died and rose again, even so them
also which a sleep in Jesus will God
bring with him.
15 For this we say unto you by the
word of the Lord, a that b we which
are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not c prevent
them which are asleep.
16 For the Lord himself shall a descend from heaven with b a shout,
with the voice of the c archangel, and with the d trump of God:
and the dead in Christ shall e rise
first:
17 a Then we which are alive and
remain shall be b caught up together
with them in the clouds, to meet
the c Lord in the d air: and so shall
we e ever be with the f Lord.
18 Wherefore comfort one another
with these words.

4 But ye, brethren, are not in a darkness, that that b day should overtake
you as a thief.
5 Ye are all the a children of light,
and the children of the day: we are
not of the night, nor of darkness.
6 Therefore let us not a sleep, as
do others; but let us b watch and be c sober.
7 For they that sleep sleep in the
night; and they that be drunken are
drunken in the night.
8 But let us, who are of the day, be a sober, putting on the b breastplate
of c faith and love; and for an hel- met, the d hope of salvation.
9 For God hath not appointed us
to a wrath, but to obtain b salvation
by our Lord Jesus Christ,
10 Who died for us, that, whether
we wake or sleep, we should a live
together with him.
11 Wherefore a comfort yourselves
together, and b edify one another,
even as also ye do.
12 And we beseech you, brethren,
to know them which a labour among
you, and are over you in the Lord,
and admonish you;
13 And to a esteem them very highly
in love for their work’s sake. And be
at b peace among yourselves.
14 Now we exhort you, brethren, a warn them that are b unruly, c com- fort the d feebleminded, e support
the f weak, be patient toward all
men.
15 See that none a render b evil for
evil unto any c man; but ever follow
that which is good, both among
yourselves, and to all men.
16 a Rejoice evermore.
17 a Pray without ceasing.
18 In every thing give a thanks: for
this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
concerning you.
19 a Quench not the b Spirit.
20 Despise not prophesyings.
21 a Prove all things; hold fast that
which is good.
22 a Abstain from all b appearance
of c evil.
23 And the very God of peace a sanc- tify you wholly; and I pray God your
whole spirit and soul and body be
preserved blameless unto the com- ing of our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Second Epistle of
Paul the Apostle to the
Thessalonians
Chapter 1
At His Second Coming, the Lord Jesus
will take vengeance upon the ungodly.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, a unto the b church of
the Thessalonians in God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Grace unto you, and peace, from
God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
because that your faith groweth ex­ ceedingly, and the charity of every
one of you all toward each other
aboundeth;
4 So that we ourselves glory in
you in the a churches of God for
your b patience and faith in all your c persecutions and tribulations that
ye endure:
5 Which is a manifest token of the
righteous judgment of God, that
ye may be counted worthy of the
kingdom of God, for which ye also
a suffer:
6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with
God to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you;
7 And to you who are troubled a rest
with us, when the b Lord Jesus shall
be c revealed from heaven with his
mighty d angels,
8 In flaming a fire taking b vengeance on them that know not God,
and that c obey not the d gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ:
9 Who shall be a punished with b everlasting c destruction from the
presence of the Lord, and from the
glory of his power;
10 When he shall come to be a glo­ rified in his b saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was
believed) in that day.
11 Wherefore also we pray always 
2 Thessalonians 1:12–2:16 1504
for you, that our God would count
you a worthy of this calling, and
fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness, and the work of faith with
power:
12 That the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ may be glorified in you, and
ye in him, according to the a grace of
our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Chapter 2
Apostasy is to precede the Second
Coming—The gospel prepares men for
eternal glory.
Now we beseech you, brethren, a by
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and by our gathering together unto
him,
2 That ye be not soon shaken in
mind, a or be troubled, neither by
spirit, nor by word, nor by b letter as
from us, as that the c day of Christ
is at hand.
3 Let no man deceive you by any
means: a for that day shall not come,
except there come a b falling away
first, and that c man of d sin be re- vealed, the son of perdition;
4 Who a opposeth and exalteth
himself above all that is called God,
or that is worshipped; so that he as
God sitteth in the temple of God,
shewing himself that he is God.
5 Remember ye not, that, when I
was yet with you, I told you these
things?
6 And now ye know a what withholdeth that he might be b revealed
in his time.
7 a For the b mystery of c iniquity
doth already work: only d he who
now letteth will let, until he be taken
out of the way.
8 And then shall that a Wicked be
revealed, whom the Lord shall con- sume with the spirit of his mouth,
and shall destroy with the bright- ness of his b coming:
9 Even him, whose coming is after
the working of Satan with all a power
and b signs and lying wonders,
10 And with all deceivableness of
unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the
love of the truth, that they might
be saved.
11 And for this cause God shall
send them strong delusion, that
they should believe a lie:
12 That they all might be a damned
who b believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness.
13 But we are bound to give thanks
alway to God for you, brethren
beloved of the Lord, because God
hath from the beginning a chosen
you to salvation through b sancti- fication of the Spirit and belief of
the truth:
14 Whereunto he called you by
our a gospel, to the obtaining of the
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast,
and hold the traditions which ye
have been taught, whether by word,
or our epistle.

17 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
work.
Chapter 3
Pray for the triumph of the gospel
cause—Paul preaches the gospel of
work—Be not weary in well-doing.
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that
the word of the Lord a may have free
course, and be glorified, even as it
is with you:
2 And that we may be delivered
from a unreasonable and wicked
men: for all men have not faith.
3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall
stablish you, and keep you from a evil.
4 And we have a confidence in the
Lord touching you, that ye both do
and will do the things which we
command you.
5 And the Lord a direct your hearts
into the b love of God, and into the
patient waiting for Christ.
6 Now we command you, brethren,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye a withdraw yourselves from
every brother that walketh b disorderly, and not after the tradition
which he received of us.
7 For yourselves know how ye
ought to a follow us: for we b behaved
not ourselves disorderly among
you;
8 Neither did we eat any man’s
bread a for nought; but wrought with b labour and travail night and day,
that we might not be chargeable to
any of you:
9 Not because we have not a power,
but to make ourselves an b ensample
unto you to follow us.
10 For even when we were with
you, this we commanded you, that
if any would not a work, neither
should he eat.
11 For we hear that there are some
which walk among you a disorderly,
working not at all, but are busy- bodies.
12 Now them that are such we
command and exhort by our Lord
Jesus Christ, that with quietness
they work, and eat their own a bread.
13 But ye, brethren, be not a weary
in well doing.
14 And if any man obey not our
word by this epistle, note that man,
and have no company with him,
that he may be ashamed.
15 Yet count him not as an a enemy,
but b admonish him as a c brother.
16 Now the Lord of peace himself
give you peace always by all means.
The Lord be with you all.
17 The salutation of Paul with mine
own a hand, which is the token in
every epistle: so I write.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all. Amen.

The First Epistle of
Paul the Apostle to
Timothy
Chapter 1
Counsel is given to teach true doctrine
only—Christ came to save repentant
sinners.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
by the commandment of God
our Saviour, and Lord Jesus
Christ, which is our hope;
2 Unto a Timothy, b my c own son in
the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace,
from God our Father and Jesus
Christ our Lord.
3 As I besought thee to abide still at
Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some
that they a teach no b other doctrine,
4 Neither give heed to a fables and
endless genealogies, which b minister c questions, rather than godly d edifying which is in faith: so do.
5 Now the end of the a command­ ment is b charity out of a c pure heart,
and of a good conscience, and of
faith unfeigned:
6 From which some having a swerved have b turned aside unto c vain jangling;
7 Desiring to be teachers of the
law; understanding neither what
they say, nor whereof they a affirm.
8 But we know that the law is good,
if a man use it lawfully;
9 Knowing this, that the a law is not
made for a b righteous man, but for
the c lawless and d disobedient, for
the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of
fathers and murderers of mothers,
for manslayers,
10 For a whoremongers, for b them
that c defile themselves with mankind, for d menstealers, for liars, for
perjured persons, and if there be
any other thing that is contrary to
sound e doctrine;
11 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
committed to my a trust.
12 And I thank Christ Jesus our
Lord, who hath a enabled me, for
that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
13 Who was before a a blasphemer,
and a b persecutor, and c injurious:
but I obtained d mercy, because I did
it e ignorantly in unbelief.
14 And the a grace of our Lord was
exceeding abundant with faith and
love which is in Christ Jesus.
15 This is a faithful a saying, and
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ 
1507 1 Timothy 1:16–2:12
Jesus came into the world to b save c sinners; of whom I am chief.
16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained a mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ
might shew forth all b longsuffering, for a c pattern to them which
should hereafter believe on him to
life everlasting.
17 Now unto the a King eternal, b immortal, invisible, the only wise
God, be honour and glory for ever
and ever. Amen.
18 This charge I commit unto
thee, son Timothy, according to the
a prophecies which went before on
thee, that thou by them mightest
war a good warfare;
19 a Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
away concerning faith have made
b shipwreck:
20 Of whom is a Hymenæus and b Alexander; whom I have c delivered
unto Satan, that they may learn not
to blaspheme.
Chapter 2
We should pray for all people—Christ
is our Mediator—Women should dress
modestly—Women are blessed in childbearing and are admonished to continue
in faith, charity, and holiness.
I exhort therefore, that, first of all,
supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks, be made for
all men;
2 For a kings, and for all that are in
authority; that we may lead a quiet
and b peaceable c life in all godliness
and d honesty.
3 For this is good and acceptable
in the sight of God our Saviour;
4 a Who b will have c all men to be d saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
5 For there is a one God, and one b mediator between God and men,
the man Christ Jesus;
6 Who a gave himself a b ransom
for all, to be c testified in due time.
7 Whereunto I am a ordained a b preacher, and an c apostle, (I speak
the truth in Christ, and d lie not;)
a teacher of the e Gentiles in faith
and f verity.
8 I a will therefore that men b pray
every where, lifting up holy c hands,
without wrath and d doubting.
9 In like manner also, that a women
adorn themselves in b modest c ap- parel, with d shamefacedness and
sobriety; not with e broided hair, or
gold, or pearls, or costly array;
10 But (which becometh women
professing a godliness) with good
works.
11 Let the woman learn in a silence
with all subjection.

Chapter 3
Qualifications are given for bishops
and deacons—Great is the mystery of
godliness.
This is a true a saying, If a man desire
the office of a b bishop, he desireth
a good work.
2 A bishop then must be a blameless,
the husband of one wife, vigilant,
b sober, of good behaviour, given to
c hospitality, apt to d teach;
3 Not given to a wine, no b striker,
not greedy of c filthy lucre; but pa- tient, not a brawler, not covetous;
4 One that a ruleth well his own b house, having his c children in subjection with all gravity;
5 (For if a man know not how to a rule his own house, how shall he
take care of the church of God?)
6 Not a a novice, lest being lifted
up with b pride he fall into the c condemnation of the devil.
7 Moreover he must have a good a report of them which are b without;
lest he fall into reproach and the
c snare of the devil.
8 Likewise must the a deacons be b grave, not c doubletongued, not
given to much wine, not greedy of
filthy lucre;
9 Holding the mystery of the faith
in a pure a conscience.
10 And let these also first be a proved; then let them use the office
of a deacon, being found blameless.
11 a Even so must their b wives be c grave, not d slanderers, e sober, f faithful in all things.
12 Let the deacons be the husbands
of one wife, ruling their children
and their own houses well.
13 For they that have used the
office of a deacon well a purchase
to themselves a good degree, and
great boldness in the faith which
is in Christ Jesus.
14 These things write I unto thee,
hoping to come unto thee shortly:

16 And without controversy great is
the a mystery of godliness: b God was c manifest in the d flesh, e justified in
the Spirit, seen of angels, preached
unto the Gentiles, believed on in
the world, f received up into glory.
Chapter 4
Paul describes the latter-day apostasy—
Christ is the Savior of all men, especially
of those who believe.
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly,
that in the a latter times some shall b depart from the faith, giving heed
to c seducing spirits, and d doctrines
of devils;
2 Speaking a lies in b hypocrisy; having their c conscience seared with a
hot iron;
3 a Forbidding to b marry, and commanding to c abstain from d meats,
which God hath e created to be received with f thanksgiving of them
which believe and know the truth.
4 For every a creature of God is b good, and nothing to be refused,
if it be received with c thanksgiving:
5 For it is sanctified by the word
of God and prayer.
6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
shalt be a good minister of Jesus
Christ, nourished up in the words of
faith and of good doctrine, a whereunto thou hast attained.
7 But refuse profane and old wives’
fables, and exercise thyself rather
unto godliness.
8 For bodily exercise profiteth a little: but b godliness is profitable unto
all things, having promise of the
life that now is, and of that which
is to come.
9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
10 For therefore we both a labour
and suffer b reproach, because we c trust in the living God, who is the
d Saviour of all men, specially of
those that e believe.
11 These things command and
teach.
12 Let no man a despise thy youth;
but be thou an b example of the be- lievers, in word, in c conversation, in
charity, in spirit, in faith, in d purity.
13 Till I come, give attendance to a reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
14 a Neglect not the b gift that is
in thee, which was given thee by
c prophecy, with the d laying on of
the e hands of the f presbytery.

the doctrine; continue in them: for
in doing this thou shalt both a save
thyself, and them that hear thee.
Chapter 5
Saints are to care for their worthy
poor—Policies concerning elders are
given.
a Rebuke not an elder, but b entreat
him as a father; and the younger
men as brethren;
2 The elder women as mothers; the
younger as a sisters, with all purity.
3 Honour a widows that are widows indeed.
4 But if any widow have a children
or b nephews, let them learn first to
shew c piety at home, and to requite
their parents: for that is good and
acceptable before God.
5 Now she that is a widow indeed,
and a desolate, trusteth in God, and
continueth in supplications and
prayers night and day.
6 But she that liveth a in b pleasure
is dead while she liveth.
7 And these things a give in charge,
that they may be blameless.
8 But if any a provide not for his
own, and specially for those of
his own house, he hath denied the
faith, and is worse than an infidel.
9 Let not a widow be taken into
the number under threescore years
a old, having been the wife of one
man,
10 Well reported of for good
works; if she have brought up children, if she have a lodged strangers,
if she have b washed the saints’ c feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently fol- lowed every good work.
11 But the younger widows refuse:
for when they have begun to wax
wanton against Christ, they will
marry;
12 Having a damnation, because
they have cast off their first faith.
13 And withal they learn to be a idle, wandering about from house
to house; and not only idle, but tat- tlers also and b busybodies, speaking
things which they ought not.
14 I a will therefore that the younger b women marry, bear c children, guide
the d house, give none occasion to the
adversary to speak reproachfully.
15 For some are already turned
aside after Satan.
16 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them a relieve them, and let not the church be
b charged; that it may relieve them
that are widows indeed.
17 Let the a elders that rule well be
counted worthy of double honour,
especially they who labour in the
word and doctrine.
18 For the scripture saith, Thou
shalt not a muzzle the ox that tread- eth out the corn. And, The b labourer
is worthy of his c reward.
19 Against an elder receive not an
accusation, but before two or three

things b without preferring one
before another, doing nothing by
partiality.
22 a Lay b hands suddenly on no c man, neither be d partaker of other
men’s sins: keep thyself e pure.
23 Drink no longer water, but use
a little wine for thy stomach’s sake
and thine often infirmities.
24 Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
and some men they a follow after.
25 Likewise also the good works
of some are manifest beforehand;
and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
Chapter 6
The love of money is the root of all
evil—Fight the good fight of faith—Do
not trust in worldly riches.
Let as many a servants as are under
the b yoke count their own masters
worthy of all honour, that the name
of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
2 And they that have believing
masters, let them not despise them,
because they are a brethren; but
rather do them b service, because
they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things
teach and exhort.
3 If any man a teach otherwise, and
consent not to b wholesome words,
even the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and to the doctrine which
is according to godliness;
4 He is a proud, knowing nothing,
but b doting about c questions and d strifes of words, whereof cometh
e envy, strife, railings, f evil surmisings,
5 Perverse a disputings of men of
corrupt minds, and destitute of the
truth, supposing that b gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
6 But a godliness with b contentment
is great gain.
7 For we brought a nothing into
this world, and it is certain we can
carry nothing out.
8 And having a food and raiment
let us be therewith b content.
9 But a they that will be b rich fall
into c temptation and a snare, and
into many foolish and hurtful d lusts,
which drown men in destruction
and e perdition.
10 For the a love of b money is the
root of all evil: which while some
c coveted after, they have d erred from
the faith, and pierced themselves
through with many e sorrows.
11 But thou, O man of God, flee
these things; and follow after a righ- teousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
12 Fight the good fight of faith,
lay hold on a eternal life, where- unto thou art also called, and hast
b professed a good profession before
many witnesses.

until the appearing of our Lord
Jesus Christ:
15 a Which in his times he shall
shew, who is the blessed and only b Potentate, the c King of kings, and

The Second Epistle of
Paul the Apostle to
Timothy
Chapter 1
Christ brings immortality and eternal
life through the gospel—Be strong in
the faith.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
by the will of God, according
to the a promise of life which
is in Christ Jesus,
2 To Timothy, my dearly beloved
son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from
God the Father and Christ Jesus
our Lord.
3 I thank God, whom I serve from
my forefathers with pure a con­ science, that without ceasing I have
remembrance of thee in my prayers
night and day;
4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may
be filled with joy;
5 When I call to remembrance the 
1513 2 Timothy 1:6–2:6
unfeigned faith that is in thee, which
dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois,
and thy mother a Eunice; and I am
persuaded that in thee also.
6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou a stir up the b gift of
God, which is in thee by the putting
on of my c hands.
7 For God hath not given us the
spirit of a fear; but of b power, and of c love, and of a sound mind.
8 Be not thou therefore a ashamed
of the b testimony of our Lord, nor
of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
9 Who hath saved us, and called us
with an holy a calling, not according
to our works, but according to his
own purpose and b grace, which was
given us in Christ Jesus before the
world began,
10 But is now made a manifest by
the appearing of our Saviour Jesus
Christ, who hath abolished b death,
and hath brought c life and d immor- tality to light through the gospel:
11 Whereunto I am a appointed
a preacher, and an b apostle, and a
teacher of the Gentiles.
12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am
not a ashamed: for I know whom I
have believed, and am persuaded
that he is able to keep that which I
have committed unto him against
that day.
13 Hold fast the a form of b sound
words, which thou hast heard of
me, in faith and love which is in
Christ Jesus.
14 That good thing which was
committed unto thee keep by the
Holy Ghost which a dwelleth in us.
15 This thou knowest, that all they
which are in Asia be a turned away
from me; of whom are Phygellus
and Hermogenes.
16 The Lord give mercy unto the
house of Onesiphorus; for he oft a refreshed me, and was not ashamed
of my chain:
17 But, when he was in Rome, he
sought me out very diligently, and
found me.
18 The Lord grant unto him that
he may find a mercy of the Lord in
that day: and in how many things
he ministered unto me at Ephesus,
thou knowest very well.
Chapter 2
Christ gives eternal glory to the elect—
Shun contention and seek godliness.
Thou therefore, my son, be strong
in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 And the things that thou hast
heard of me among many witnesses,
the same commit thou to faithful
men, who shall be able to a teach
others also.
3 Thou therefore endure a hardness,
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
4 No man that warreth entangleth
himself with the affairs of this life;
that he may please him who hath
chosen him to be a soldier.
5 And if a man also a strive for b masteries, yet is he not c crowned,
except he strive lawfully.

must be first a partaker of the
fruits.
7 Consider what I say; and the
Lord give thee understanding in all
things.
8 Remember that Jesus Christ of
the seed of David was a raised from
the dead according to my b gospel:
9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an
evil doer, even unto bonds; but the
word of God is not bound.
10 Therefore I endure all things
for the elect’s sakes, that they may
also obtain the salvation which is
in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
11 It is a faithful saying: For if we
be a dead with him, we shall also
live with him:
12 If we a suffer, we shall also b reign
with him: if we c deny him, he also
will deny us:
13 If we a believe not, yet he
abideth faithful: he cannot b deny
himself.
14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before
the Lord that they a strive not about
words to no profit, but to the sub- verting of the hearers.
15 a Study to shew thyself approved
unto God, a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, b rightly dividing
the word of truth.
16 But shun profane and a vain bab- blings: for they will increase unto
more b ungodliness.
17 And their a word will eat as doth
a canker: of whom is b Hymenæus
and Philetus;
18 Who concerning the truth have a erred, saying that the resurrection
is past already; and overthrow the
faith of some.
19 Nevertheless the foundation of
God standeth sure, having this seal,
The Lord knoweth them that are
his. And, Let every one that nameth
the name of Christ depart from
iniquity.
20 But in a great house there are
not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of a earth;
and some to honour, and some to
dishonour.
21 If a man therefore purge him- self from these, he shall be a a vessel
unto honour, b sanctified, and c meet
for the master’s use, and prepared
unto every good work.
22 Flee also youthful a lusts: but
follow b righteousness, faith, charity, c peace, with them that call on the
Lord out of a d pure heart.
23 But a foolish and unlearned b questions avoid, knowing that they
do gender c strifes.
24 And the servant of the Lord
must not a strive; but be gentle unto
all men, apt to b teach, patient,
25 In a meekness b instructing those
that oppose themselves; if God c peradventure will give them repen- tance to the acknowledging of the
truth;
26 And that they may recover them- selves out of the snare of the devil,
who are taken a captive by him at
his will.

Chapter 3
Paul describes the apostasy and perilous
times of the last days—The scriptures
guide man to salvation.
This know also, that in the a last days
perilous b times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their
own selves, a covetous, boasters, b proud, blasphemers, c disobedient
to parents, d unthankful, unholy,
3 Without a natural b affection, c trucebreakers, d false accusers, e incontinent, fierce, despisers of those
that are good,
4 a Traitors, b heady, c highminded,
lovers of d pleasures more than lovers of God;
5 Having a a form of godliness, but b denying the power thereof: from
such turn away.
6 For of this sort are they which
creep into houses, and lead captive
silly a women laden with sins, led
away with divers b lusts,
7 Ever a learning, and never able
to come to the b knowledge of the c truth.
8 Now as Jannes and Jambres
withstood Moses, so do these also
a resist the truth: men of b corrupt
minds, reprobate concerning the
faith.
9 But they shall proceed no further: for their a folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also
was.
10 But thou hast a fully known
my doctrine, manner of life, pur- pose, faith, longsuffering, charity,
patience,
11 Persecutions, afflictions, which
came unto me at Antioch, at Ico- nium, at Lystra; what a persecutions
I endured: but out of them all the
Lord delivered me.
12 Yea, and all that will live a godly
in Christ Jesus shall b suffer c persecution.
13 But evil men and a seducers shall
wax worse and worse, deceiving,
and being deceived.
14 But a continue thou in the things
which thou hast learned and hast
been assured of, knowing of whom
thou hast learned them;
15 And that from a a child thou hast
known the holy b scriptures, which
are able to make thee c wise unto d salvation through faith which is
in Christ Jesus.
16 a All b scripture is given by c inspi- ration of God, and is d profitable for e doctrine, for f reproof, for correction,
for g instruction in h righteousness:
17 That the man of God may be a perfect, throughly furnished unto
all b good works.

Chapter 4
Paul gives a solemn charge to preach
the gospel in a day of apostasy—Paul
and all Saints are assured of exaltation.
I charge thee therefore before God,
and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
a judge the quick and the dead at his
appearing and his kingdom;
2 a Preach the word; b be c instant
in season, out of season; d reprove,
rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
3 For the time will come when
they will not a endure sound b doctrine; but after their own c lusts shall
they heap to themselves d teachers,
having itching ears;
4 And they shall turn away their
ears from the a truth, and shall be
turned unto b fables.
5 But a watch thou in all things,
endure afflictions, do the work of
an b evangelist, c make full proof of
thy ministry.
6 For I am now ready to be offered,
and the time of my departure is at
hand.
7 I have fought a good a fight, I
have b finished my course, I have
kept the faith:
8 Henceforth there is laid up for me
a a crown of b righteousness, which
the Lord, the righteous c judge, shall
give me at that day: and not to me
only, but unto all them also that
love his appearing.
9 Do thy diligence to come shortly
unto me:
10 For a Demas hath b forsaken me,
having loved this present c world,
and is departed unto Thessalon- ica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto
Dalmatia.
11 Only a Luke is with me. Take b Mark, and bring him with thee:
for he is profitable to me for the
ministry.
12 And Tychicus have I sent to
Ephesus.
13 The cloak that I left at Troas
with Carpus, when thou comest,
bring with thee, and the a books, but
especially the parchments.
14 Alexander the coppersmith did
me much evil: the Lord reward him
according to his a works:
15 Of whom be thou ware also;
for he hath greatly a withstood
our words.
16 At my first a answer no man
stood with me, but all men forsook
me: I pray God that it may not be
laid to their b charge.
17 Notwithstanding the a Lord
stood with me, and strengthened me;
that by me the preaching might be
fully known, and that all the Gentiles
might hear: and I was delivered out
of the mouth of the lion.
18 And the Lord shall deliver me
from every evil work, and will a preserve me unto his heavenly king- dom: to whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.

The Epistle of Paul to
Titus
Chapter 1
Eternal life was promised before the
world began—The qualifications of
bishops are given—Unto the pure, all
things are pure.
Paul, a a servant of God, and an b apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s c elect,
and the acknowledging of the truth
which is after godliness;
2 In a hope of b eternal life, which
God, that cannot c lie, d promised before the world began;
3 But hath in due times manifested
his word through preaching, which is
committed unto me according to the
commandment of God our Saviour;
4 To Titus, a mine own son after the
common faith: Grace, mercy, and
peace, from God the Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
5 For this cause left I thee in Crete,
that thou shouldest set in a order the
things that are wanting, and b or­ dain c elders in every city, as I had d appointed thee:
6 If any be blameless, the husband
of one wife, having faithful children
not accused of a riot or unruly.
7 For a a bishop must be blame­ less, as the b steward of God; not c selfwilled, not soon d angry, not
given to wine, no striker, not given
to filthy lucre;
8 But a lover of a hospitality, a
lover of b good men, sober, just, holy, c temperate;
9 Holding fast the faithful word as
he hath been taught, that he may
be able by sound doctrine both to
exhort and to a convince the b gainsayers.
10 For there are many unruly
and a vain talkers and b deceivers,
specially they of the c circumcision:
11 Whose mouths must be stopped,
who subvert whole houses, teaching 
Titus 1:12–2:12 1518
things which they ought not, for
filthy a lucre’s sake.
12 One of themselves, even a prophet
of their own, said, The Cretians are
alway liars, evil beasts, a slow bellies.
13 This witness is true. Wherefore a rebuke them sharply, that they may
be sound in the faith;
14 Not giving heed to Jewish a fables, and b commandments of men, c that turn from the truth.
15 a Unto the pure all things are b pure: but unto them that are c defiled and unbelieving is nothing
pure; but even their d mind and e conscience is f defiled.
16 They a profess that they b know
God; but in c works they d deny him,
being abominable, and e disobe- dient, and unto every good work
f reprobate.
Chapter 2
Saints should live righteously, deny ungodliness, and seek the Lord.
But a speak thou the things which
become sound b doctrine:
2 That the a aged men be b sober,
grave, c temperate, sound in faith,
in charity, in patience.
3 The aged women likewise, that
they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness, not a false b accusers, not
given to much wine, teachers of
good things;
4 That they may teach the young a women to be sober, to b love their
husbands, to love their children,
5 To be discreet, a chaste, b keepers at c home, good, obedient to their own
husbands, that the word of God be
not blasphemed.
6 Young men likewise exhort to
be sober minded.
7 In all things shewing thyself a
pattern of good works: in doctrine
shewing uncorruptness, a gravity, b sincerity,
8 a Sound speech, that cannot be b condemned; that he that is c of the
contrary part may be ashamed,
having no evil thing to say of you.
9 Exhort a servants to be obedient
unto their own masters, and to please
them well in all things; not b answering again;
10 Not a purloining, but shewing all
good fidelity; that they may b adorn
the doctrine of God our Saviour in
all things.
11 For the a grace of God b that
bringeth salvation hath appeared
to all men,
12 Teaching us that, denying a ungodliness and b worldly c lusts, we
should live d soberly, e righteously,
and godly, in this present world;

Christ;
14 Who gave a himself for us, that
he might b redeem us from all iniquity, and c purify unto himself a d peculiar people, e zealous of good
works.
15 These things speak, and exhort,
and a rebuke with all b authority. Let
no man c despise thee.
Chapter 3
Saints must live righteously after
baptism.
Put them in mind to be a subject to b principalities and powers, to obey
magistrates, to be ready to every
good work,
2 To a speak evil of no man, to be b no brawlers, but gentle, shewing
all c meekness unto all men.
3 For we ourselves also were a sometimes foolish, b disobedient, deceived,
serving divers c lusts and pleasures,
living in d malice and envy, hateful,
and hating one another.
4 But after that the kindness and
love of God our Saviour toward man
appeared,
5 Not by works of a righteousness
which we have done, but according
to his b mercy he saved us, by the c washing of regeneration, and d re- newing of the Holy Ghost;
6 Which he shed on us abundantly
through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
7 That being a justified by his grace,
we should be made b heirs according
to the hope of eternal life.
8 This is a faithful saying, and
these things I will that thou affirm
constantly, that they which have
believed in God might be careful to
maintain good a works. These things
are good and profitable unto men.
9 But avoid a foolish questions, and
genealogies, and b contentions, and
strivings about the law; for they are
unprofitable and vain.
10 A man that is an a heretick af- ter the first and second b admonition reject;
11 Knowing that he that is such
is a subverted, and sinneth, being
condemned of himself.
12 When I shall send Artemas
unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
to come unto me to Nicopolis: for
I have determined there to winter.
13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and
Apollos on their journey diligently,
that nothing be wanting unto them.
14 And let a ours also learn to maintain b good works for necessary uses,
that they be not unfruitful.
15 All that are with me salute thee.
Greet them that love us in the faith.
Grace be with you all. Amen.

The Epistle of Paul to
Philemon
The gospel changes a servant into a
brother.
Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ,
and Timothy our brother, unto
Philemon our dearly beloved,
and fellowlabourer,
2 And to our beloved Apphia, and a Archippus our fellowsoldier, and
to the church in thy house:
3 Grace to you, and peace, from
God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
5 Hearing of thy love and faith,
which thou hast toward the Lord
Jesus, and toward all saints;
6 That the a communication of thy
faith may become b effectual by the
acknowledging of every good thing
which is in you in Christ Jesus.
7 For we have great joy and con­ solation in thy love, because the
a bowels of the saints are refreshed
by thee, brother.
8 Wherefore, though I might be
much bold in Christ to enjoin thee
that which is convenient,
9 Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech
thee, being such an one as Paul the
aged, and now also a prisoner of
Jesus Christ.
10 I beseech thee for my son a Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
bonds:
11 Which in time past was to thee
unprofitable, but now profitable to
thee and to me:
12 Whom I have sent again: thou
therefore receive him, that is, mine
own bowels:
13 Whom I would have retained
with me, that in thy stead he might
have ministered unto me in the
bonds of the gospel:
14 But without thy a mind would I
do nothing; that thy benefit should
not be as it were of necessity, but
willingly.
15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
16 Not now as a servant, but above
a servant, a a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more
unto thee, both in the flesh, and in
the Lord?
17 If thou count me therefore a
partner, receive him as myself.
18 If he hath wronged thee, or
oweth thee a ought, put that on mine
account;
19 I Paul have written it with mine
own hand, I will repay it: albeit I
do not say to thee how thou owest
unto me even thine own self besides.
20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of
thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels
in the Lord.
21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that
thou wilt also do more than I say.
22 But withal prepare me also a
lodging: for I trust that through your
a prayers I shall be given unto you.
23 There salute thee a Epaphras,
my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
24 Marcus, Aristarchus, a Demas,
Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
25 The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
¶ Written from Rome to Philemon, by
Onesimus a servant.
Chapter 1
The Son is in the express image of the
person of the Father—Christ is the
Only Begotten Son and thus above
the angels.
God, who a at sundry times and
in divers manners spake in
time past unto the b fathers
by the c prophets,
2 Hath in these last days spoken
unto us by his a Son, whom he hath b appointed c heir of all things, by
whom also he d made the e worlds;
3 Who being the brightness of his a glory, and the express image of his
b person, and upholding all things
by the word of his c power, when
he had by himself d purged our sins,
sat down on the e right hand of the
f Majesty on high;
4 Being made so much better than
the angels, as he hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent a name
than they.
5 For unto which of the angels said
he at any time, Thou art my a Son,
this day have I begotten thee? And
again, I will be to him a b Father,
and he shall be to me a Son?
6 And again, when he bringeth in
the a firstbegotten into the world, he
saith, b And let all the angels of God c worship him.
7 And of the angels he saith, Who
maketh his angels spirits, and his
ministers a flame of fire.
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy a throne, O God, is for b ever and
ever: a sceptre of righteousness is
the sceptre of thy kingdom.
9 Thou hast loved a righteousness,
and hated iniquity; therefore God,
even thy God, hath anointed thee
with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.
10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the a foundation of
the earth; and the heavens are the
works of thine b hands:
11 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall a wax old
as doth a garment;
12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold

he at any time, Sit on my a right
hand, until I make thine enemies
thy footstool?
14 Are they not all a ministering b spirits, sent forth c to minister for
them who shall be heirs of salvation?
Chapter 2
Jesus came to suffer death and save
men—He came to make reconciliation
for the sins of the people.
Therefore we ought to give the
more a earnest b heed to the things
which we have heard, lest at any
time we should let them slip.
2 For if the word spoken by angels
was steadfast, and every transgression and a disobedience received a b just recompence of reward;
3 How shall we a escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at
the first began to be spoken by the
Lord, and was confirmed unto us
by them that heard him;
4 God also bearing them witness,
both with a signs and b wonders,
and with divers miracles, and gifts
of the Holy Ghost, according to his
own c will?
5 For unto the angels hath he not
put in subjection the world to come,
whereof we speak.
6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is a man, that thou
art mindful of him? or the son of
man, that thou visitest him?
7 Thou madest him a little lower
than the a angels; thou crownedst him
with glory and honour, and didst
set him over the works of thy hands:
8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his a feet. For in that
he put all in subjection under him,
he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all
things put under him.
9 But we see Jesus, who was made
a little a lower than the b angels c for
the suffering of d death, e crowned
with glory and honour; that he by
the f grace of God should taste g death
for every man.
10 For a it became him, for whom
are all things, and by whom are
all b things, in bringing many sons
unto glory, to make the c captain
of their salvation d perfect through
sufferings.
11 For both he that sanctifieth
and they who are a sanctified are
all of b one: for which cause he is
not ashamed to call them c brethren,
12 Saying, I will declare thy a name
unto my brethren, in the midst of
the church will I sing praise unto
thee.
13 And again, I will put my a trust
in him. And again, Behold I and
the children which God hath given
me.
14 a Forasmuch then as the children
are partakers of b flesh and blood,
he also himself likewise took part
of the same; that through death he
might c destroy him that had the
power of d death, that is, the e devil;

16 For verily he took not on him
the nature of a angels; but he took on
him the b seed of Abraham.
17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things
pertaining to God, to make a reconciliation for the sins of the people.
18 For in that he himself hath suffered being a tempted, he is able to b succour them that are tempted.
Chapter 3
Christ is the Apostle and High Priest of
our profession—Jesus, being the Son, is
more than a servant—Now is the time
and the day of our salvation.
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, a consider
the b Apostle and c High Priest of our
profession, Christ Jesus;
2 Who was faithful to him that
appointed him, as also Moses was
faithful in all his house.
3 For this man was counted worthy
of more glory than Moses, inasmuch
as he who hath builded the house
hath more honour than the house.
4 For every house is builded by
some man; but he that built all
things is God.
5 And Moses verily was faithful
in all his house, as a a servant, for
a testimony of those things which
were to be spoken after;
6 But Christ as a son over his own
a house; whose b house are we, if we
hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
7 Wherefore (as the a Holy Ghost
saith, b To day if ye will hear his
voice,
8 a Harden not your hearts, as in the b provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
9 When your fathers tempted me, a proved me, and saw my works
forty years.
10 Wherefore I was grieved with
that a generation, and said, They do
alway err in their heart; and they
have not known my ways.
11 So I sware in my wrath, They
shall not a enter into my b rest.)
12 Take heed, brethren, lest there
be in any of you an evil a heart of b unbelief, in c departing from the
living God.
13 But a exhort one another daily,
while it is called b To day; lest any
of you be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin.
14 For we are made partakers of
Christ, if we hold the beginning
of our confidence a steadfast unto
the end;
15 While it is said, To day if ye
will hear his voice, a harden not
your hearts, as in the b provocation.
16 For some, when they had heard,
did provoke: howbeit not all that
came out of Egypt by Moses.
17 But with whom was he grieved
forty years? was it not with them
that had sinned, whose a carcases
fell in the wilderness?

18 And to whom sware he that they
should not enter into his rest, but
to them that believed not?
19 So we see that they could not
enter in because of a unbelief.
Chapter 4
The gospel was offered to ancient Israel—Saints enter into the rest of the
Lord—Though tempted in all points,
Jesus was without sin.
Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into
his a rest, any of you should seem
to come short of it.
2 For unto us was the a gospel
preached, as well as unto them: but
the word preached did not profit
them, not being mixed with b faith
in them that heard it.
3 a For we which have believed do
enter into rest, as he said, As I have
sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my b rest: although the works
were finished from the foundation
of the world.
4 For he spake in a certain place of
the a seventh day on this wise, And
God did rest the seventh day from
all his works.
5 a And in this place again, If they
shall enter into my rest.
6 Seeing therefore it remaineth
that some must enter therein, and
a they to whom it was first preached
entered not in because of b unbelief:
7 Again, he a limiteth a certain day,
saying in David, To day, after so
long a time; as it is said, To day if
ye will b hear his voice, c harden not
your hearts.
8 For if a Jesus had given them rest,
then would he not afterward have
spoken of another day.
9 There remaineth therefore a rest
to the people of God.
10 For he that is entered into his
rest, he also hath ceased from his
own works, as God did from his.
11 Let us a labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall
after the same example of b unbelief.
12 For the a word of God is b quick,
and powerful, and sharper than any
twoedged c sword, d piercing even to
the dividing asunder of e soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow,
and is a f discerner of the g thoughts
and h intents of the heart.
13 Neither is there any creature
that is not manifest in his sight:
but all things are naked and opened
unto the a eyes of him with whom
we have to do.
14 Seeing then that we have a great
high priest, that is passed into the
a heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let
us hold fast our profession.
15 For we have not an high priest a which cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities; but was
in all points b tempted like as we are,
yet without c sin.
16 Let us therefore come boldly
unto the throne of a grace, that we
may obtain mercy, and find grace
to help in time of need.

Chapter 5
For a man to hold the priesthood, he
must be called of God as was Aaron—
Christ was a priest forever after the
order of Melchizedek—Jesus Christ is
the Author of eternal salvation.
For every high priest taken from
among men is a ordained for men
in things pertaining to God, that he
may offer both gifts and b sacrifices
for sins:
2 Who can have a compassion on
the ignorant, and on them that are
b out of the way; for that he himself
also is compassed with infirmity.
3 And by reason hereof he ought,
as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for a sins.
4 And no man taketh this a honour
unto himself, but he that is b called
of God, as was c Aaron.
5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but
he that said unto him, Thou art my
a Son, to day have I begotten thee.
6 As he saith also in another place,
Thou art a a priest b for ever after the
order of c Melchisedec.
7 Who in the days of his flesh, when
he had offered up a prayers and supplications with b strong crying and
tears unto him that was able to save
him from death, and was heard c in
that he feared;
8 Though he were a Son, yet a learned he b obedience by the things
which he c suffered;
9 And being made a perfect, he became the b author of eternal c salvation unto all them that obey him;
10 a Called of God an b high priest
after the order of Melchisedec.
11 Of whom we have many things
to say, and a hard to be b uttered, seeing ye are dull of c hearing.
12 For when for the time ye ought
to be teachers, ye have need that
one teach you again which be the
first principles of the oracles of God;
and are become such as have need
of a milk, and not of strong meat.
13 For every one that useth a milk is
unskilful in the word of righteous- ness: for he is a babe.
14 But strong meat belongeth to
them that are of full age, even those
who by reason of use have their
senses exercised to discern both
good and evil.

the foundation of  c repentance from
dead works, and of faith toward God,
2 Of the a doctrine of b baptisms,
and of c laying on of d hands, and
of resurrection of the dead, and of
eternal judgment.
3 a And this will we do, if God
permit.
4 For it is impossible for those who
were once a enlightened, and have
tasted of the heavenly gift, and were
made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
5 And have a tasted the good word
of God, and the powers of the b world
to come,
6 If they shall a fall away, to renew
them again unto repentance; seeing
they b crucify to themselves the Son
of God afresh, and put him to an
open c shame.
7 For the earth which drinketh
in the rain that cometh oft upon
it, and bringeth forth herbs a meet
for them by whom it is b dressed,
receiveth blessing from God:
8 But that which beareth thorns
and briers is rejected, and is nigh
unto a cursing; whose end is to be
burned.
9 But, beloved, we are persuaded
better things of you, and things
that accompany salvation, though
we thus speak.
10 For God is not a unrighteous to
forget your work and b labour of c love, which ye have shewed toward
his d name, in that ye have minis- tered to the saints, and do minister.
11 And we desire that every one
of you do shew the same a diligence
to the full assurance of hope unto
the end:
12 That ye be not a slothful, but followers of them who through b faith
and c patience inherit the d promises.
13 For when God made promise to
Abraham, because he could a swear
by no greater, he b sware by himself,
14 Saying, Surely blessing I will a bless thee, and multiplying I
will multiply thee.
15 And so, after he had patiently a endured, he obtained the promise.
16 For men verily swear by the
greater: and an a oath for confirmation is to them an end of all b strife.
17 Wherein God, willing more
abundantly to shew unto the heirs
of promise the immutability of his
a counsel, b confirmed it by an c oath:
18 That by two immutable things,
in which it was impossible for
God to a lie, we might have a strong
consolation, who have fled for b ref- uge to lay hold upon the c hope set
before us:
19 Which hope we have as an a anchor of the soul, both sure and
steadfast, and which entereth into
that within the b veil;
20 Whither the forerunner is for us
entered, even Jesus, made an a high
priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.

—The superiority of the Melchizedek
Priesthood over the Aaronic Priesthood
is explained—Salvation comes through
the intercession of Christ.
For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, a priest of the most high God, who
met Abraham returning from the
slaughter of the kings, and blessed
him;
2 To whom also Abraham gave a a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of b righteousness,
and after that also King of c Salem,
which is, King of peace;
3 a Without father, without mother,
without descent, having neither
b beginning of days, nor end of life;
but made like unto the Son of God;
abideth a c priest continually.
4 Now consider how great this man
was, unto whom even the a patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the
spoils.
5 And verily they that are of the
sons of a Levi, who receive the b office
of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their
brethren, though they come out of
the loins of Abraham:
6 But he whose descent is not
counted from them received tithes
of Abraham, and blessed him that
had the promises.
7 And without all contradiction
the less is blessed of the better.
8 And here men that die receive
tithes; but there he receiveth them,
of whom it is witnessed that he
liveth.
9 And as I may so say, Levi also,
who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
in Abraham.
10 For he was yet in the loins of his
father, when Melchisedec met him.
11 If therefore a perfection were by
the b Levitical priesthood, (for under
it the people received the law,) what
further need was there that another
priest should rise after the order of
Melchisedec, and not be called after
the order of Aaron?
12 For the a priesthood being
changed, there is made of neces- sity a change also of the law.
13 For he of whom these things are
spoken pertaineth to another tribe,
of which no man gave attendance
at the altar.
14 For it is evident that our Lord
sprang out of a Juda; of which tribe
Moses spake nothing concerning
priesthood.
15 And it is yet far more evident:
for that after the similitude of
Melchisedec there ariseth another
priest,
16 Who is made, not after the law
of a a carnal commandment, but after
the power of an endless life.
17 For he testifieth, Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of
a Melchisedec.
18 For there is verily a disannulling
of the commandment going before
for the a weakness and unprofitable- ness thereof.
19 a For the law made nothing b perfect, but the bringing in of a
c better hope did; by the which we
draw nigh unto God.
20 And inasmuch as not without
an a oath he was made priest:
21 (For those a priests were made
without an oath; but this with an
b oath by him that said unto him,
The Lord sware and will not repent,

22 By so much was Jesus made a
surety of a better a testament.
23 And they truly were many
priests, because they were not suf- fered to continue by reason of death:
24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
a priesthood.
25 Wherefore he is able also to save
them a to the uttermost that b come
unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make c intercession for them.
26 a For such an b high priest became
us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, c separate from d sinners, and made e higher than the f heavens;
27 Who needeth not a daily, as those
high priests, to offer up b sacrifice,
first for his own sins, and then for
the people’s: for this he did c once,
when he d offered up himself.
28 For the law maketh men high
priests which have infirmity; but
the word of the a oath, which was
since the law, maketh the b Son, who
is c consecrated for evermore.
Chapter 8
Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice
for sin—God promised to make a new
covenant with Israel.
Now of the things which we have
spoken this is the sum: We have
such an a high priest, who is set on
the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens;
2 A minister of the sanctuary, and
of the a true b tabernacle, which the
Lord pitched, and not man.
3 For every high priest is ordained
to offer gifts and sacrifices: where- fore it is of necessity that this man
have somewhat also to a offer.
4 a For if he were on earth, he
should not be a priest, seeing that
there are b priests that offer gifts
according to the law:
5 Who serve unto the example and a shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he
was about to make the b tabernacle:
for, See, saith he, that thou make
all things according to the c pattern
shewed to thee in the mount.
6 But now hath he obtained a more
excellent ministry, by how much
also he is the a mediator of a better b covenant, which was established
upon better c promises.
7 For if that first covenant had been a faultless, then should no place have
been sought for the second.
8 For finding fault with them, he
saith, Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, when I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel
and with the house of a Judah:
9 Not according to the a covenant
that I made with their fathers in
the day when I took them by the
hand to lead them out of the land

not in my covenant, and I regarded
them not, saith the Lord.
10 For this is the covenant that I
will make with the house of Israel
after those days, saith the Lord; I
will put my a laws into their b mind,
and write them in their c hearts: and
I will be to them a God, and they
shall be to me a people:
11 And they shall not teach every
man his neighbour, and every man
his brother, saying, Know the Lord:
for all shall know me, from the least
to the greatest.

Chapter 9
The Mosaic ordinances prefigured
Christ’s ministry—Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant.
Then verily the first a covenant had
also b ordinances of divine c service,
and a worldly sanctuary.
2 For there was a a tabernacle
made; the first, wherein was the b candlestick, and the c table, and
the d shewbread; which is called the
sanctuary.
3 And after the second a veil, the
tabernacle which is called the b Ho- liest of all;
4 Which had the golden censer,
and the a ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein
was the golden b pot that had manna,
and c Aaron’s rod that budded, and
the d tables of the covenant;
5 And over it the a cherubims of
glory shadowing the b mercyseat;
of which we cannot now speak par- ticularly.
6 Now when these things were thus a ordained, the b priests went always
into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
7 But into the second went the a high
priest alone b once every year, not
without blood, which he offered
for himself, and for the errors of
the people:
8 The Holy Ghost this signifying,
that the way into the holiest of all
was not yet made manifest, while as
the first tabernacle was yet standing:
9 Which was a a figure for the time
then present, in which were offered
both gifts and sacrifices, that could
not make him that did the service
b perfect, as pertaining to the con- science;
10 Which stood only in meats and
drinks, and divers a washings, and b carnal c ordinances, d imposed on
them until the time of reformation.
11 But Christ being come an a high
priest of good things to come, by a
greater and more perfect b taberna- cle, not made with hands, that is to
say, not of this building;
12 Neither by the blood of goats
and calves, but by his own a blood he

entered in once into the b holy place,
having obtained eternal c redemption for us.
13 For if the a blood of bulls and
of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth
to the b purifying of the flesh:
14 How much more shall the a blood
of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself b without c spot
to God, d purge your e conscience
from dead works to serve the living
God?
15 And for this cause he is the a mediator of the b new c testament,
that by means of d death, for the re- demption of the e transgressions that
were under the first f testament, they
which are called might receive the
g promise of eternal h inheritance.
16 For where a a testament is, there
must also of necessity be the b death
of the c testator.
17 For a a testament is of force af- ter men are dead: b otherwise it is
of no strength at all while the tes- tator liveth.
18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.
19 For when Moses had a spoken
every precept to all the people
according to the law, he took the
b blood of calves and of goats, with
water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop,
and c sprinkled both the book, and
all the people,
20 Saying, This is the blood of the
testament which God hath enjoined
unto you.
21 Moreover he sprinkled with
blood both the tabernacle, and all
the vessels of the ministry.
22 And almost all things are by the
law purged with blood; and without
a shedding of blood is no b remission.
23 It was therefore necessary that
the a patterns of things in the heav- ens should be purified with these;
but the heavenly things themselves
with better sacrifices than these.
24 For Christ is not entered into
the holy places made with hands,
which are the figures of the a true;
but into b heaven itself, now to appear in the c presence of God for us:
25 Nor yet that he should offer
himself often, as the a high priest
entereth into the holy place every
year with blood of others;
26 For then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the
world: but now once a in the b end of
the world hath he appeared to put
away sin by the c sacrifice of himself.
27 And as it is appointed unto
men once to die, but after this the
judgment:
28 So Christ was once a offered to b bear the c sins of many; and unto
them that look for him shall he d ap- pear the second time without sin
unto salvation.

Chapter 10
We are sanctified by the shedding of
the blood of Christ—The superiority of
His sacrifice is explained—Those who
fall from grace through willful sin are
damned—The just will live by faith.
For the a law having a b shadow of
good things to come, and not the very
image of the things, can never with
those sacrifices which they offered
c year by year continually make the
comers thereunto perfect.
2 For then would they not have
ceased to be offered? because that
the worshippers once a purged should
have had no more b conscience of
sins.
3 But in those a sacrifices there is a b remembrance again made of sins
every year.
4 For it is not possible that the
blood of bulls and of goats should
take away sins.
5 Wherefore when he cometh into
the world, he saith, Sacrifice and
offering thou wouldest not, but a
body hast thou prepared me:
6 In burnt offerings and a sacrifices
for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the
volume of the book it is written of
me,) to do thy will, O God.
8 Above when he said, Sacrifice
and offering and burnt offerings
and offering for sin thou wouldest
not, neither hadst pleasure therein;
which are offered by the law;
9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy
will, O God. He taketh away the first,
that he may establish the second.
10 By the which will we are a sanctified through the b offering c of the d body of Jesus Christ e once for all.
11 And every priest standeth a daily
ministering and offering oftentimes
the same sacrifices, which can never
take away b sins:
12 But this man, after he had
offered one a sacrifice for sins for
ever, sat down on the right hand of
God;
13 a From henceforth expecting till
his enemies be made his footstool.
14 For by one offering he hath
perfected for ever them that are
sanctified.
15 Whereof the a Holy Ghost also
is a b witness to us: for after that he
had said before,
16 This is the a covenant that I will
make with them after those days,
saith the Lord, I will put my laws
into their hearts, and in their b minds
will I write them;
17 And their sins and iniquities
will I remember no more.
18 Now where a remission of these
is, there is no more offering for sin.
19 Having therefore, brethren, a boldness to enter into the b holiest
by the blood of Jesus,
20 By a new and living way, which
he hath consecrated for us, through
the a veil, that is to say, his flesh;
21 And having an a high priest over
the house of God;
22 Let us a draw b near with a true
heart in full assurance of c faith,
having our hearts d sprinkled from
an evil e conscience, and our bodies
washed with pure water.

23 Let us hold fast the a profession
of our b faith without wavering; (for
he is faithful that promised;)
24 And let us a consider one another to b provoke unto love and to
good works:
25 Not forsaking the a assembling
of ourselves together, as the man- ner of some is; but exhorting one
another: and so much the more, as
ye see the day approaching.
26 For if we a sin b wilfully after that
we have received the knowledge of
the truth, there remaineth no more
sacrifice for sins,
27 But a certain fearful looking for
of judgment and fiery a indignation,
which shall devour the adversaries.
28 He that a despised Moses’ law
died without mercy under two or
three witnesses:
29 Of how much sorer a punishment,
suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot
the Son of God, and hath counted
the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
thing, and hath done b despite unto
the Spirit of grace?
30 For we know him that hath
said, a Vengeance belongeth unto me,
I will b recompense, saith the Lord.
And again, The Lord shall c judge
his people.
31 It is a fearful thing to fall into
the hands of the living God.
32 But call to remembrance the
former days, in which, after ye were
illuminated, ye endured a great
a fight of afflictions;
33 Partly, whilst ye were made a
gazingstock both by reproaches and
afflictions; and partly, whilst ye
became companions of them that
were so used.
34 For ye had compassion of me
in my bonds, and took a joyfully the
spoiling of your goods, knowing in
yourselves that ye have in heaven a
better and an enduring b substance.
35 Cast not away therefore your
confidence, which hath great rec- ompence of reward.
36 For ye have need of a patience,
that, after ye have done the b will of
God, ye might receive the c promise.
37 For yet a little while, and he
that shall come will come, and will
not tarry.
38 Now the just shall live by faith:
but if any man a draw back, my soul
shall have no pleasure in him.
39 But we are not of them who a draw back unto b perdition; but of
them that believe to the saving of
the soul.

which do appear.
4 By faith a Abel offered unto God a
more excellent b sacrifice than Cain,
by which he obtained witness that
he was righteous, God testifying of
his gifts: and by it he being dead
yet speaketh.
5 By faith a Enoch was b translated
that he should not see death; and
was not found, because God had
translated him: for before his translation he had this c testimony, that
he pleased God.
6 But without a faith it is impossible
to please him: for he that b cometh
to God must believe that he is, and
that he is a c rewarder of them that d diligently e seek him.
7 By faith a Noah, being b warned
of God of things not seen as yet,
c moved with fear, prepared an ark
to the saving of his house; by the
which he condemned the world, and
became heir of the d righteousness
which is by faith.
8 By faith a Abraham, when he was
called to go out into a place which
he should after receive for an b inheritance, c obeyed; and he went
out, not d knowing whither he went.
9 By faith he a sojourned in the b land of c promise, as in a strange
country, dwelling in d tabernacles
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
him of the same promise:
10 For he looked for a a city which
hath foundations, whose builder
and maker is God.
11 Through faith also Sara herself
received strength to conceive seed,
and was delivered of a child when
she was past age, because she judged
him faithful who had promised.
12 Therefore sprang there even
of one, and him as good as dead, so
many as the stars of the sky in a multitude, and as the sand which is by
the sea shore innumerable.
13 These all died in faith, not
having received the a promises, but
having seen them afar off, and were
persuaded of them, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were b strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
14 For they that say such things
declare plainly that they seek a
a country.
15 And truly, if they had been
mindful of that country from whence
they came out, they might have had
opportunity to have returned.
16 But now they desire a better a country, that is, an heavenly: where- fore God is not ashamed to be called
their God: for he hath prepared for
them a city.
17 By a faith Abraham, when he
was b tried, c offered up Isaac: and
he that had received the d promises
offered up his only begotten son,
18 Of whom it was said, That in a Isaac shall thy b seed be called:
19 a Accounting that God was able
to raise him up, even from the dead;
from whence also he received him
in a figure.

a dying, blessed both the sons of
Joseph; and worshipped, leaning
upon the top of his staff.
22 By faith a Joseph, when he died,
made mention of the departing of
the children of Israel; and gave
commandment concerning his
bones.
23 By faith a Moses, when he was
born, was hid three months of his
parents, because they saw he was a b proper child; and they were not
afraid of the king’s commandment.
24 By faith Moses, when he was
come to years, refused to be called
the a son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
25 Choosing rather to a suffer affliction with the b people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season;
26 Esteeming the a reproach of
Christ greater b riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect
unto the recompence of the reward.
27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not
fearing the wrath of the king: for
he endured, as seeing him who is
invisible.
28 Through faith he kept the a passover, and the sprinkling of b blood,
lest he that destroyed the firstborn
should touch them.
29 By faith they passed through
the a Red sea as by dry land: which
the Egyptians assaying to do were
drowned.
30 By faith the a walls of Jericho fell
down, after they were compassed
about seven days.
31 By a faith the harlot b Rahab per- ished not with c them that believed
not, when she had received the spies
with peace.
32 And what shall I more say ?
for the time would fail me to tell
of Gedeon, and of a Barak, and of
Samson, and of b Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the
prophets:
33 Who through faith subdued
kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
obtained a promises, stopped the
mouths of b lions,
34 Quenched the violence of a fire,
escaped the edge of the sword, out of
weakness were made b strong, waxed
valiant in fight, turned to flight the
armies of the aliens.
35 Women received their dead
raised to life again: and others were
tortured, not accepting a deliverance;
that they might obtain b a better
resurrection:
36 And others had trial of a cruel b mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
37 They were a stoned, they were
sawn asunder, were tempted, were
slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and
goatskins; being destitute, afflicted,
tormented;
38 (Of whom the world was not
worthy:) they wandered in deserts,
and in mountains, and in dens and
caves of the earth.
39 And these all, having obtained
a a good b report through faith, re- ceived not the promise:
40 a God having b provided some
better thing for us, that they without us should not be made c perfect.

Chapter 12
Whom the Lord loves He chastens—God
is the Father of spirits—To see God, fol- low peace and holiness—Exalted Saints
belong to the Church of the Firstborn.
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud
of witnesses, let us lay aside every
weight, and the a sin which doth
so easily b beset us, and let us run
with c patience the race that is set
before us,
2 Looking unto Jesus the a author
and b finisher of our faith; who for
the joy that was set before him
c endured the cross, despising the
d shame, and is set down at the right
hand of the e throne of God.
3 For consider him that endured
such a contradiction of sinners
against himself, lest ye be wearied
and faint in your minds.
4 Ye have not yet resisted unto
blood, a striving against sin.
5 And ye have forgotten the exhor- tation which speaketh unto you as
unto children, My son, despise not
thou the chastening of the Lord, nor
faint when thou art rebuked of him:
6 For whom the Lord loveth he a chasteneth, and scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth.
7 If ye a endure b chastening, God
dealeth with you as with c sons; for
what son is he whom the father
chasteneth not?
8 But if ye be without chastisement,
whereof all are partakers, then are
ye bastards, and not sons.
9 Furthermore we have had a fathers
of our flesh which b corrected us,
and we gave them c reverence: shall
we not much rather be in d subjection unto the e Father of f spirits,
and live?
10 For they verily for a few days
chastened us after their own plea- sure; but he for our profit, that we
might be partakers of his a holiness.
11 Now no chastening for the
present seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous: nevertheless afterward
it yieldeth the a peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are
b exercised thereby.
12 Wherefore lift up the hands
which hang down, and the a feeble
knees;
13 And make straight paths for
your feet, lest that which is lame
be turned out of the way; but let it
rather be a healed.
14 Follow a peace with all men, and b holiness, without which no man
shall c see the Lord:
15 Looking diligently lest any
man a fail of the b grace of God; lest
any root of bitterness springing up
trouble you, and thereby many be
defiled;
16 Lest there be any fornicator, or
profane person, as Esau, who for one
morsel of meat sold his a birthright.
17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inher- ited the blessing, he was rejected:
for he found no place of repentance,
though he sought it carefully with
a tears.

18 For ye are not come unto the a mount that might be touched,
and that burned with fire, nor
unto blackness, and darkness, and
tempest,
19 And the sound of a trumpet,
and the voice of words; which a voice
they that heard entreated that the
word should not be spoken to them
any more:
20 (For they could not endure that
which was commanded, And if so
much as a beast touch the mountain,
it shall be stoned, or thrust through
with a dart:
21 And so terrible was the sight,
that Moses said, I exceedingly fear
and quake:)
22 But ye are come unto mount a Sion, and unto the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to
an innumerable company of  b angels,
23 To the general assembly and
church of the a firstborn, which are b written in heaven, and to God the
c Judge of all, and to the d spirits of e just men made perfect,
24 And to Jesus the a mediator of the b new c covenant, and to the d blood
of sprinkling, that speaketh e better
things than that of Abel.
25 See that ye refuse not him that
speaketh. For if they a escaped not
who refused him that spake on earth,
much more shall not we escape, if we
turn away from him that speaketh
from heaven:
26 Whose voice then shook the
earth: but now he hath promised,
saying, Yet once more I a shake not
the earth only, but also heaven.
27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things
that are shaken, as of things that are
made, that those things which can- not be shaken may remain.
28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
have grace, whereby we may serve
God acceptably with a reverence and
godly b fear:
29 For our God is a consuming fire.
Chapter 13
Marriage is honorable—Christ is the
same everlastingly—Paul explains
how the Saints are to offer acceptable
sacrifices.
Let a brotherly b love continue.
2 Be not forgetful to a entertain b strangers: for thereby some have
entertained c angels d unawares.
3 Remember them that are in a bonds, as bound with them; and
them which b suffer adversity, as
being yourselves also in the body.
4 a Marriage is honourable in all,
and the bed undefiled: but b whoremongers and c adulterers God will d judge.
5 Let your conversation be without a covetousness; and be b content with
such things as ye have: for he hath
said, I will never leave thee, nor
c forsake thee.
6 So that we may boldly say, The
Lord is my helper, and I will not
fear what man shall do unto me.
7 Remember them which have the
rule over you, who have spoken unto
you the word of God: whose faith
follow, considering the end of their
conversation.

9 Be not a carried about with divers
and strange b doctrines. For it is a
good thing that the heart be estab- lished with grace; not with meats,
which have not profited them that
have been occupied therein.
10 We have an altar, whereof they
have no right to eat which serve the
tabernacle.
11 For the bodies of those beasts,
whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the high priest for
sin, are burned without the camp.
12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he
might a sanctify the people with
his own b blood, c suffered d without
the gate.
13 Let us go forth therefore unto
him without the camp, bearing his
a reproach.
14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
15 By him therefore let us offer
the a sacrifice of praise to God con- tinually, that is, the b fruit of our lips
giving thanks to his name.
16 But to do good and to a communicate forget not: for with such
b sacrifices God is well pleased.
17 a Obey them that have the rule
over you, and b submit yourselves: for
they watch for your souls, as they
that must give account, that they
may do it with joy, and not with
grief: for that is unprofitable for you.
18 Pray for us: for we trust we have
a good a conscience, in all things
willing to live b honestly.
19 But I beseech you the rather to
do this, that I may be restored to
you the sooner.
20 Now the God of peace, that
brought again from the dead our
Lord Jesus, that great a shepherd of
the sheep, through the blood of the
b everlasting c covenant,
21 Make you perfect in every good a work to do his b will, working in you
that which is wellpleasing in his
sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom
be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
22 And I beseech you, brethren,
suffer the word of exhortation: for
I have written a letter unto you in
few words.
23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if
he come shortly, I will see you.
24 Salute all them that have the
rule over you, and all the saints.
They of Italy salute you.

The General Epistle of
James
Chapter 1
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
of God—Resist temptation—Be doers
of the word—James explains how to
recognize pure religion.
J
ames, a a servant of God and
of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
twelve tribes which are b scattered
abroad, greeting.
2 My brethren, count it all joy when
ye fall into a divers b temptations;
3 Knowing this, that the a trying of
your faith worketh b patience.
4 But let patience have her perfect
work, that ye may be a perfect and
entire, wanting nothing.
5 a If any of you lack b wisdom, let
him ask of God, that c giveth to all
men liberally, and d upbraideth not;
and it shall be given him.
6 But let him a ask in b faith, nothing c wavering. For he that wavereth is
like a wave of the sea driven with
the wind and tossed.
7 For let not that man think that he
shall receive any thing of the Lord.
8 A a double minded man is unsta­ ble in all his ways.
9 Let the brother of a low degree
rejoice in that he is exalted:
10 But the rich, in that he is made
low: because as the flower of the
a grass he shall pass away.
11 For the sun is no sooner risen
with a burning heat, but it withereth
the grass, and the flower thereof
falleth, and the a grace of the fash­ ion of it perisheth: so also shall the
b rich man fade away in his ways.
12 a Blessed is the man that b en­ dureth temptation: for when he is
c tried, he shall receive the d crown
of life, which the Lord hath prom­ ised to them that love him.
13 Let no man say when he is
tempted, I am tempted of God: for
God cannot be a tempted with b evil,
neither tempteth he any man:
14 But every man is a tempted,
when he is drawn away of his own
b lust, and enticed.
15 Then when lust hath conceived,
it bringeth forth a sin: and sin,
when it is finished, bringeth forth
death.
16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.
17 Every a good b gift and every per­ fect c gift is from above, and d cometh
down from the e Father of lights, with
whom is no f variableness, neither
shadow of turning.
1539 James 1:18–2:8
18 Of his own will begat he us with
the word of truth, that we should be
a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear,
slow to a speak, b slow to c wrath:
20 For the wrath of man worketh
not the righteousness of God.
21 Wherefore lay apart all a filthiness and b superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with c meekness
the d engrafted word, which is able
to save your souls.
22 But be ye a doers of the word,
and not hearers only, deceiving your
own selves.
23 For if any be a a hearer of the
word, and not a doer, he is like unto
a man beholding his natural face
in a b glass:
24 For he beholdeth himself, and
goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
25 But whoso looketh into the perfect a law of b liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful
hearer, but a doer of the work, this
man shall be blessed in his deed.
26 If any man among you seem
to be religious, and bridleth not
his a tongue, but deceiveth his own
heart, this man’s religion is b vain.
27 Pure a religion and undefiled
before God and the Father is this,
To b visit the c fatherless and d wid- ows in their e affliction, and to keep
himself f unspotted from g the h world.
Chapter 2
God has chosen the poor of this world
who are rich in faith—Salvation is
gained by keeping the whole law—Faith
without works is dead.
My brethren, a have not the faith of
our b Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
glory, with respect of persons.
2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
goodly apparel, and there come in
also a a poor man in b vile raiment;
3 And ye have respect to him that
weareth the a gay clothing, and say
unto him, Sit thou here in a good
place; and say to the poor, Stand
thou there, or sit here under my
footstool:
4 a Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of
evil thoughts?
5 Hearken, my beloved brethren,
Hath not God chosen the a poor of
this world rich in faith, and heirs of
the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
6 But ye have despised the poor.
Do not rich men a oppress you, and
draw you before the judgment
seats?
7 Do not they blaspheme that
worthy a name by the which ye are
called?
8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt a love
thy b neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

9 But if ye have a respect to persons,
ye commit sin, and are convinced
of the law as transgressors.
10 For whosoever shall keep the a whole law, and yet b offend in one
point, he is c guilty of all.
11 For he that said, Do not commit a adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now
if thou commit no adultery, yet if
thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
12 So speak ye, and so do, as they
that shall be judged by the law of
a liberty.
13 For he shall have a judgment
without b mercy, that hath shewed no
mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against
judgment.
14 a What doth it profit, my breth- ren, though a man say he hath b faith,
and have not works? can faith save
him?
15 If a a brother or sister be naked,
and destitute of daily b food,
16 And one of you say unto them,
Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
filled; notwithstanding ye a give
them not those things which are
needful to the body; what doth it
profit?
17 Even so a faith, if it hath not b works, is dead, being alone.
18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast
faith, and I have works: shew me
thy faith without thy works, and
I will shew thee my a faith by my b works.
19 Thou believest that there is one
God; thou doest well: the a devils also b believe, and tremble.
20 But wilt thou know, O vain man,
that a faith without b works is dead?
21 Was not Abraham our father a justified by works, when he had
b offered Isaac his son upon the
altar?
22 Seest thou how faith wrought
with his works, and by a works was
faith made b perfect?
23 And the scripture was fulfilled
which saith, Abraham a believed God,
and it was imputed unto him for
b righteousness: and he was called
the c Friend of God.
24 Ye see then how that by a works
a man is b justified, and not by faith
only.
25 Likewise also was not a Rahab
the harlot b justified by works, when
she had received the messengers,
and had sent them out another
way ?
26 For as the body without the a spirit is b dead, so faith without c works is dead also.

same is a d perfect man, and able also
to bridle the whole body.
3 Behold, we put bits in the horses’
mouths, that they may obey us; and
we turn about their whole body.
4 Behold also the ships, which
though they be so great, and are
driven of fierce winds, yet are they
turned about with a very small
helm, whithersoever the a governor
listeth.
5 Even so the tongue is a little
member, and a boasteth great things.
Behold, how great a b matter a little
fire kindleth!
6 And the a tongue is a fire, a world
of iniquity: so is the tongue among
our members, that it defileth the
whole body, and setteth on fire the
course of nature; and it is set on
fire of hell.
7 For every kind of beasts, and of
birds, and of serpents, and of things
in the sea, is tamed, and hath been
tamed of mankind:
8 But the a tongue can no man
tame; it is an b unruly evil, full of
deadly poison.
9 Therewith bless we God, even
the Father; and therewith a curse
we men, which are made after the
b similitude of God.
10 Out of the same a mouth pro- ceedeth blessing and cursing. My
brethren, these things ought not
so to be.
11 Doth a a fountain send forth
at the same place sweet water and
bitter?
12 Can the fig tree, my brethren,
bear olive berries? either a vine,
figs? so can no fountain both yield
salt water and fresh.
13 Who is a wise man and endued
with knowledge among you? let him
shew out of a good a conversation his
works with b meekness of wisdom.
14 But if ye have bitter envying
and a strife in your hearts, b glory
not, and lie not against the truth.
15 This wisdom descendeth not
from above, but is earthly, sensual,
devilish.
16 For where a envying and b strife
is, there is confusion and every evil
work.
17 But the a wisdom that is from
above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, and b easy to be entreated, full
of c mercy and good fruits, without
partiality, and without d hypocrisy.
18 And the fruit of a righteousness
is sown in b peace of them that make c peace.
Chapter 4
Wars are born of lusts—The friends of
the world are the enemies of God—Sin
is failure to walk in the light we have
received.
From whence come a wars and b fight- ings among you? come they not hence,
even of your c lusts that war in your
members?
2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and
desire to have, and cannot obtain:
ye fight and war, yet ye have not,
because ye ask not.
3 Ye a ask, and receive not, because
ye b ask c amiss, that ye may d consume
it upon your e lusts.

James 4:5–5:5 1542
know ye not that the friendship of
the b world is c enmity with God?
whosoever therefore will be a
friend of the world is the d enemy
of God.
5 Do ye think that the scripture
saith in vain, The spirit that dwell- eth in us lusteth to a envy ?
6 But he giveth more a grace.
Wherefore he saith, God resisteth
the b proud, but giveth grace unto
the c humble.
7 a Submit yourselves therefore to
God. b Resist the c devil, and he will
flee from you.
8 a Draw b nigh to God, and he will
draw nigh to you. c Cleanse your
hands, ye sinners; and d purify your
hearts, ye double minded.
9 a Be afflicted, and mourn, and b weep: let your laughter be turned to
c mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
10 a Humble yourselves in the
sight of the Lord, and he shall lift
you up.
11 a Speak not evil one of another,
brethren. He that speaketh evil of
his brother, and judgeth his brother,
speaketh evil of the b law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the
law, thou art not a doer of the law,
but a judge.
12 There is one lawgiver, who is
able to save and to destroy: who art
thou that a judgest another?
13 Go to now, ye that say, To day
or to a morrow we will go into such a
city, and continue there a year, and
buy and sell, and get gain:
14 Whereas ye know not what shall
be on the morrow. For what is your
life? It is even a a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then
vanisheth away.
15 For that ye ought to say, If the
Lord will, we shall live, and do this,
or that.
16 But now ye rejoice in your a boastings: all such rejoicing is
evil.
17 Therefore to him that a knoweth
to do good, and b doeth it not, to him
it is c sin.
Chapter 5
Misery awaits the wanton rich—Await
the Lord’s coming with patience—The
elders are to anoint and heal the sick.
Go to now, ye rich men, a weep and
howl for your miseries that shall
come upon you.
2 Your a riches are corrupted, and
your garments are motheaten.
3 Your a gold and silver is b cankered; and the c rust of them shall
be a witness against you, and shall
eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have
heaped treasure together for the last
days.
4 Behold, the a hire of the b labourers
who have reaped down your fields,
which is of you kept back by fraud,
crieth: and the cries of them which
have reaped are entered into the
ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
5 Ye have lived a in pleasure on the
earth, and been wanton; ye have
nourished your hearts, as in a day
of slaughter.

6 Ye have condemned and killed
the just; and he doth not resist you.
7 Be patient therefore, brethren,
unto the coming of the Lord. Be- hold, the husbandman waiteth for
the precious fruit of the earth, and
hath long patience for it, until he
receive the early and latter rain.
8 Be ye also a patient; b stablish your
hearts: for the c coming of the Lord
draweth nigh.
9 a Grudge not one against another,
brethren, lest ye be condemned:
behold, the judge standeth before
the door.
10 Take, my brethren, the prophets,
who have spoken in the name of the
Lord, for an a example of b suffering
affliction, and of patience.
11 Behold, we count them a happy
which b endure. Ye have heard of
the patience of c Job, and have seen
the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
very d pitiful, and of tender e mercy.
12 But above all things, my brethren, a swear not, neither by heaven,
neither by the earth, neither by any
other b oath: but let your yea be yea;
and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into
condemnation.
13 Is any among you a afflicted?
let him pray. Is any merry ? let him
sing psalms.
14 Is any a sick among you? let him
call for the b elders of the church; and
let them c pray over him, d anointing him with oil in the name of
the Lord:
15 And the a prayer of b faith shall
save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
him up; and if he have committed
sins, they shall be c forgiven him.
16 a Confess your faults one to another, and b pray one for another,
that ye may be healed. c The effectual d fervent e prayer of a righteous
man availeth much.
17 Elias was a man subject to like a passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain: and
it b rained not on the earth by the
space of three years and six months.
18 And he prayed again, and the
heaven gave rain, and the earth
brought forth her fruit.
19 Brethren, if any of you do err
from the truth, and one convert him;
20 Let him know, that he which a converteth the sinner from the
error of his way shall b save a soul
from death, and shall c hide a mul- titude of sins.

The First Epistle General of
Peter
Chapter 1
The trial of our faith precedes salvation—Christ was foreordained to be
the Redeemer.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus
Christ, to the a strangers scat­ tered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
2 a Elect according to the b foreknowledge of God the Father,
through c sanctification of the Spirit,
unto d obedience and e sprinkling
of the f blood of Jesus Christ: Grace
unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
3 Blessed be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant a mercy hath b begotten us again unto a c lively d hope by the resurrection of e Jesus
Christ from the dead,
4 To an a inheritance incorruptible,
and undefiled, and that fadeth not
away, reserved in heaven for you,
5 Who are kept by the a power of
God through b faith unto salvation c ready to be revealed in the last
time.
6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice,
though now for a a season, if need be,
ye are in heaviness through manifold b temptations:
7 That the a trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
gold that perisheth, though it be
tried with fire, might be found unto
praise and honour and glory at the
b appearing of Jesus Christ:
8 Whom having not seen, ye love;
in whom, though now ye see him
not, yet a believing, ye rejoice with
joy unspeakable and full of glory:
9 Receiving the a end of your b faith,
even the c salvation of your souls.
10 Of which a salvation the b prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace
that should come unto you:
11 Searching what, or what manner
of time the Spirit of Christ which
was in them did signify, when it
a testified beforehand the b sufferings of Christ, and the c glory that
should follow.
12 Unto whom it was revealed, that
not unto themselves, but unto us
they did minister the things, which
are now reported unto you by them
that have a preached the gospel unto
you with the Holy Ghost sent down
from heaven; which things the b angels desire to look into.
13 Wherefore gird up the loins of
your mind, be a sober, and hope b to 
1545 1 Peter 1:14–2:6
the end for the c grace that is to be
brought unto you at the revelation
of Jesus Christ;
14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the
former a lusts in your b ignorance:
15 But as he which hath called you
is holy, so be ye a holy in all manner
of b conversation;
16 Because it is written, Be ye holy;
for I am a holy.
17 And if ye call on the Father, who
without respect of persons judgeth
according to every man’s a work,
pass the time of your sojourning
here in b fear:
18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye
were not a redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from
your b vain conversation received by c tradition from your fathers;
19 But with the precious a blood of
Christ, as of a b lamb without c blemish and without spot:
20 a Who verily was b foreordained
before the foundation of the world,
but was manifest in these last times
for you,
21 Who by him do believe in God,
that raised him up from the dead,
and gave him a glory; that your b faith
and c hope might be in God.
22 Seeing ye have a purified your b souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit unto unfeigned c love of
the brethren, see that ye d love one
another with a pure heart fervently:
23 Being a born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
by the word of God, which liveth
and b abideth for ever.
24 For all a flesh is as grass, and all
the glory of man as the flower of
grass. The grass withereth, and the
flower thereof falleth away:
25 But the a word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
which by the gospel is preached
unto you.
Chapter 2
Converts are newborn babes in Christ—
He is the chief cornerstone—Saints hold
a royal priesthood and are a peculiar
people—Saints are in subjection to the
laws of man.
Wherefore laying aside all a mal- ice, and all b guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, and all evil c speakings,
2 As a newborn babes, desire the b sincere c milk of the word, that ye
may grow thereby:
3 If so be ye have a tasted that the
Lord is gracious.
4 To whom coming, as unto a living
stone, disallowed indeed of men,
but a chosen of God, and precious,
5 Ye also, as a lively stones, are
built up a b spiritual c house, an holy
priesthood, to offer up d spiritual e sacrifices, acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ.

1 Peter 2:7–20 1546
the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a
chief a corner b stone, elect, precious:
and he that c believeth on him shall
not be d confounded.
7 Unto you therefore which believe
he is precious: but unto them which
be a disobedient, the stone which
the builders b disallowed, the same
is made the head of the corner,
8 And a a stone of b stumbling, and
a c rock of d offence, even to them
which e stumble at the word, being
disobedient: whereunto also they
were f appointed.
9 But ye are a a chosen generation, a b royal c priesthood, an d holy e nation,
a f peculiar people; that ye should
shew forth the praises of him who
hath called you out of g darkness
into his marvellous h light:
10 Which in time past were not a
people, but are now the people of
God: which had not obtained mercy,
but now have obtained mercy.
11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you
as a strangers and b pilgrims, c ab- stain from fleshly d lusts, which e war
against the soul;
12 Having your conversation a honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas
they speak against you as evildoers,
they may by your good b works, which
they shall behold, glorify God in the
day of visitation.
13 a Submit yourselves to every b ordinance of man for the Lord’s
sake: whether it be to the king, as
c supreme;
14 Or unto governors, as unto them
that are sent by him for the pun- ishment of evildoers, and for the
praise of them that do well.
15 For so is the will of God, that
with well doing ye may put to a silence the b ignorance of foolish men:
16 As free, and not using your a liberty for a cloak of b maliciousness,
but as the c servants of God.
17 a Honour all men. Love the b brotherhood. c Fear God. Honour the d king.
18 a Servants, be subject to your b masters with all fear; not only to
the good and gentle, but also to the
c froward.
19 For this is a thankworthy, if a
man for conscience toward God endure b grief, suffering wrongfully.
20 For what glory is it, if, when ye
be buffeted for your faults, ye shall
take it a patiently ? but if, when ye
do well, and b suffer for it, ye take it c patiently, this is d acceptable with
God.

1547 1 Peter 2:21–3:10
21 For even hereunto were ye
called: because Christ also a suffered
for us, leaving us an b example, that
ye should follow his steps:
22 Who did no a sin, neither was b guile found in his mouth:
23 Who, when he was a reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
threatened not; but b committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:
24 Who his own self a bare our b sins in his own body on the tree,
that we, being dead to sins, should
live unto righteousness: by whose
c stripes ye were healed.
25 For ye were as a sheep going
astray; but are now returned unto
the b Shepherd and c Bishop of your
souls.
Chapter 3
Husbands and wives should honor
each other—Saints should live by gospel standards—Christ preached to the
spirits in prison.
Likewise, ye a wives, be in subjection
to your own husbands; that, if any
b obey not the word, they also may
without the word be won by the
c conversation of the wives;
2 While they behold your a chaste b conversation coupled with fear.
3 Whose adorning let it not be
that outward a adorning of plaiting
the hair, and of wearing of gold, or
of putting on of apparel;
4 But let it be the hidden man of the
heart, in that which is not corrupt- ible, even the a ornament of a b meek
and quiet spirit, which is in the
sight of God of great price.
5 For after this manner in the old
time the holy a women also, who b trusted in God, adorned themselves,
being c in subjection unto their own
husbands:
6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham,
calling him lord: whose a daughters
ye are, as long as ye do well, and are
not afraid with any b amazement.
7 Likewise, ye a husbands, dwell
with them according to b knowledge,
giving c honour unto the d wife, as
unto the weaker vessel, and as being
e heirs together of the grace of life;
that your f prayers be not hindered.
8 Finally, be ye all of a one mind,
having b compassion one of an- other, love as c brethren, be d pitiful,
be e courteous:
9 Not a rendering b evil for evil, or
railing for railing: but contrariwise
blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit
a c blessing.
10 For he that will love life, and
see good days, let him a refrain his b tongue from evil, and his lips that
they speak no c guile:

the b righteous, and his ears are open
unto their c prayers: but the face of
the Lord is against them that do d evil.
13 And who is he that will harm
you, if ye be a followers of that which
is good?
14 But and if ye a suffer for b righ- teousness’ sake, c happy are ye: and
be not afraid of their terror, neither
be troubled;
15 But a sanctify the Lord God in
your hearts: and be ready always to
give b an answer to every man that
asketh you a reason of the c hope
that is in you with d meekness and e fear:
16 Having a good a conscience; that,
whereas they speak evil of you, as
of evildoers, they may be ashamed
that falsely accuse your good b con- versation in Christ.
17 For it is better, if the will of God
be so, that ye a suffer for well doing,
than for evil doing.
18 For Christ also hath once a suffered for sins, the just for the b un- just, that he might bring us to God,
being put to c death in the flesh, but
quickened by the d Spirit:
19 By which also he went and a preached unto the b spirits in c prison;
20 a Which sometime were b disobedient, when once the c longsuffering of God waited in the days of
d Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls
were e saved by f water.
21 The like figure whereunto even a baptism doth also now save us (not
the putting away of the filth of the
flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
22 Who is gone into a heaven, and
is on the right hand of God; b angels
and c authorities and powers being
made subject unto him.
Chapter 4
Peter explains why the gospel is preached
to the dead—Saints should speak as
the oracles of God—The righteous will
be tried and tested in all things.
Forasmuch then as Christ hath
suffered for us in the flesh, arm
yourselves likewise with the same

in the flesh hath ceased from c sin;

the a lusts of men, but to the will
of God.
3 For the time past of our life may
suffice us to have wrought the will
of the Gentiles, when we walked
in lasciviousness, lusts, a excess of
wine, b revellings, banquetings, and c abominable d idolatries:
4 Wherein they think it strange
that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
5 Who shall give account to him
that is ready to a judge the b quick
and the dead.
6 a For for this cause was the b gospel c preached also to them that are d dead, that they might be e judged
according to men in the flesh, but
live according to God in the spirit.
7 a But the end of all things is at
hand: be ye therefore sober, and
b watch unto prayer.
8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: a for b charity shall cover the multitude
of sins.
9 Use a hospitality one to another
without b grudging.
10 As every man hath received the
gift, even so a minister the same one
to another, as good b stewards of the
manifold grace of God.
11 If any man a speak, let him speak
as the b oracles of God; if any man
minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in
all things may be glorified through
Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and
dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
12 Beloved, think it not strange
concerning the fiery a trial which is
to try you, as though some strange
thing happened unto you:
13 But a rejoice, inasmuch as ye
are b partakers of Christ’s c sufferings; that, when his glory shall be
d revealed, ye may be glad also with
exceeding joy.
14 If ye be a reproached for the
name of Christ, b happy are ye; for
the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is
evil spoken of, but on your part he
is glorified.
15 But let none of you suffer as
a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
evildoer, or as a busybody in other
men’s matters.
16 Yet if any man suffer as a a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
let him glorify God on this behalf.
17 For the time is come that a judgment must begin at the house of
God: and if it first begin at us, what
shall the end be of them that b obey
not the gospel of God?
18 And if the a righteous scarcely
be saved, where shall the b ungodly
and the sinner appear?
19 Wherefore let them that suffer
according to the a will of God com- mit the b keeping of their souls to
him in well doing, as unto a faithful
Creator.

Chapter 5
The elders are to feed the flock of
God—Humility and godly graces lead
to perfection.
The a elders which are among you I
exhort, who am also an elder, and a
witness of the sufferings of Christ,
and also a b partaker of the glory
that shall be revealed:
2 a Feed the b flock of God which
is among you, taking the c oversight
thereof, not by constraint, but d willingly; not for e filthy f lucre, but of a
ready mind;
3 Neither as being a lords over God’s
heritage, but being b ensamples to
the flock.
4 And when the chief a Shepherd
shall appear, ye shall receive a
b crown of c glory that fadeth not
away.
5 Likewise, ye younger, a submit
yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of
you be subject one to another, and
be clothed with b humility: for God c resisteth the d proud, and giveth
grace to the e humble.
6 a Humble yourselves therefore
under the mighty hand of God, that
he may exalt you in due time:
7 Casting all your care upon him;
for he careth for you.
8 Be a sober, be b vigilant; because
your adversary the c devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking
whom he may devour:
9 Whom resist a steadfast in the
faith, knowing that the same af- flictions are b accomplished in your
brethren that are in the world.
10 But the God of all a grace, who
hath called us unto his eternal
glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye
have suffered a while, make you
b perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle
you.
11 To him be glory and dominion
for ever and ever. Amen.
12 By a Silvanus, a faithful brother
unto you, as I suppose, I have writ- ten briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God
wherein ye stand.
13 The church that is at a Bab- ylon, elected together with you,
saluteth you; and so doth Marcus
my son.
14 Greet ye one another with a
kiss of charity. Peace be with you

Peter urges the Saints to make their
calling and election sure—Prophecy
comes by the power of the Holy Ghost.
Simon Peter, a a servant and
an b apostle of Jesus Christ, to
them that have obtained c like
precious faith with us through the
d righteousness e of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
2 Grace and peace be multiplied
unto you through the a knowledge
of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
3 According as his divine power
hath given unto us a all things that
pertain unto b life and c godliness,
through the knowledge of him that
hath called us d to glory and e virtue:
4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious a prom­ ises: that by these ye might be b partakers of the c divine d nature, having e escaped the f corruption that is in
the world through g lust.
5 And beside this, giving all a diligence, add to your faith b virtue; and
to virtue c knowledge;
6 And to knowledge a temperance;
and to temperance b patience; and
to patience c godliness;
7 And to godliness a brotherly
b kindness; and to brotherly kindness c charity.
8 For if these things be in you, and a abound, they make you that ye shall
neither be b barren nor c unfruitful
in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
9 But he that lacketh these things
is blind, and cannot see afar off, and
hath forgotten that he was purged
from his old sins.
10 Wherefore the rather, brethren,
give diligence to make your calling
and a election sure: for if ye do these
things, ye shall never b fall:
11 For so an entrance shall be
ministered unto you abundantly
into the a everlasting b kingdom of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remem­ brance of these things, though ye
know them, and be established in
the present truth.
13 Yea, I think it a meet, as long as
I am in this b tabernacle, to stir you
up by putting you in remembrance;
14  Knowing that shortly I must put
off this my tabernacle, even as our
Lord Jesus Christ hath a shewed me.
15 Moreover I will endeavour that
ye may be able after my decease to

have these things always in remembrance.
16 For we have not followed cunningly devised a fables, when we
made known unto you the power
and coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, but were b eyewitnesses of his
majesty.
17 For he received from God the
Father honour and glory, when there
came such a voice to him from the
excellent glory, This is my a beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.
18 And this a voice which came
from heaven we heard, when we
were with him in the holy b mount.
19 a We have also a more b sure word
of c prophecy; whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed, as unto a light
that shineth in a dark place, until
the day dawn, and the day d star
arise in your hearts:
20 Knowing this first, that a no b prophecy of the c scripture is of any
private d interpretation.
21 For the a prophecy came not in
old time by the will of man: but
holy men of God b spake as they were c moved by the d Holy Ghost.
Chapter 2
False teachers among the Saints are
damned—Lustful Saints will perish in
their own corruption.
But there were a false prophets also
among the people, even as there
shall be b false c teachers among you,
who privily shall bring in damna- ble heresies, even denying the Lord
that d bought them, and bring upon
themselves swift destruction.
2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
way of a truth shall be evil spoken of.
3 And through covetousness shall
they with a feigned words make merchandise of you: whose b judgment
now of a long time lingereth not, and
their c damnation slumbereth not.
4 For if God spared not the a angels
that sinned, but cast them down to b hell, and delivered them into chains
of darkness, to be reserved unto
c judgment;
5 And spared not the old world,
but saved a Noah the eighth person,
a preacher of b righteousness, bringing in the c flood upon the world of
the ungodly;
6 And turning the cities of a Sodom
and Gomorrha into ashes con- demned them with an overthrow,
making them an b ensample unto
those that after should live ungodly;
7 And delivered just a Lot, b vexed
with the c filthy conversation of the
wicked:

a vexed his righteous soul from day
to day with their unlawful deeds;)
9 The Lord knoweth how to a deliver the b godly out of c temptations,
and to d reserve the unjust unto the
day of e judgment to be punished:
10 But chiefly them that a walk
after the flesh in the b lust of c uncleanness, and despise d government. e Presumptuous are they, selfwilled,
they are not afraid to speak evil of
dignities.
11 Whereas angels, which are
greater in power and might, bring
not railing accusation against them
before the Lord.
12 But these, as a natural brute
beasts, made to be taken and de- stroyed, speak evil of the things that
they understand not; and shall utterly b perish in their own corruption;
13 And shall receive the a reward of
unrighteousness, as they that count
it b pleasure to c riot in the day time.
Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
14 Having eyes full of adultery,
and that cannot cease from sin;
beguiling unstable souls: an heart
they have exercised with covetous
practices; cursed children:
15 Which have a forsaken the right b way, and are gone c astray, follow- ing the way of d Balaam the son of
Bosor, who loved the e wages of unrighteousness;
16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb a ass speaking with
man’s voice forbad the madness of
the prophet.
17 These are a wells without water,
clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the b mist of c darkness
is reserved for ever.
18 For when they a speak great
swelling words of b vanity, they c allure through the d lusts of the flesh,
through much wantonness, those that
were clean e escaped from them who
live in error.
19 While they promise them a liberty, they themselves are the b ser- vants of c corruption: for of whom
a man is overcome, of the same is
he brought in d bondage.
20 For if after they have a escaped
the b pollutions of the world through
the knowledge of the Lord and Sav- iour Jesus Christ, they are c again d entangled therein, and e overcome,
the latter end is f worse with them
than the beginning.
21 For it had been better for
them not to have a known the way
of b righteousness, than, after they
have known it, to c turn from the
holy commandment delivered unto
them.
22 But it is happened unto them
according to the true proverb, The
dog is turned to his own a vomit
again; and the sow that was b washed

Some in the latter days will doubt the
Second Coming—The elements will melt
at the coming of the Lord.
This second epistle, beloved, I now a write unto you; in both which I stir
up your pure minds by way of b remembrance:
2 That ye may be mindful of the
words which were spoken before
by the holy a prophets, and of the
commandment of us the apostles
of the Lord and Saviour:
3 a Knowing this first, that there
shall come in the b last days scoff- ers, walking after their own c lusts,
4 And saying, a Where is the b promise of his c coming? for since the
fathers fell asleep, all things con- tinue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
5 For this they willingly are a ignorant of, that by the b word of God the
heavens were of old, and the c earth
standing out of the water and in
the water:
6 Whereby the world that then
was, being a overflowed with b water, perished:
7 But the heavens and the earth,
which are now, by the same word
are kept in store, reserved unto a fire
against the day of judgment and
b perdition of ungodly men.
8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of
this one thing, that one day is with
the Lord as a thousand a years, and
a thousand years as one day.
9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is a longsuffering to
us-ward, not willing that any should
b perish, but that all should come to
c repentance.
10 But the a day of the Lord will b come as a thief in the night; in
the which the heavens shall c pass
away with a great noise, and the
d elements shall melt with fervent
heat, the e earth also and the works
that are therein shall be burned up.
11 Seeing then that all these things
shall be dissolved, what a manner
of persons ought ye to be in all holy b conversation and godliness,
12 a Looking for and b hasting unto
the c coming of the d day of God,
wherein the heavens being on fire
shall be dissolved, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat?
13 Nevertheless we, according to
his promise, look for new a heavens
and a b new c earth, wherein dwelleth d righteousness.
14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that
ye look for such things, be a diligent
that ye may be found of him in
peace, without b spot, and blameless.
15 And a account that the b longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto
him hath written unto you;
16 As also in all his epistles, speak- ing in them of these things; in which

The First Epistle General of
John
Chapter 1
The Saints gain fellowship with God by
obedience—We must confess our sins
to gain forgiveness.
a That which was from the b beginning, which we have
heard, which we have seen
with our eyes, which we have looked
upon, and our hands have handled,
of the c Word of life;
2 (For the life was manifested, and
we have seen it, and bear witness,
and a shew unto you that b eternal
life, which was with the Father, and
was manifested unto us;)
3 That which we have a seen and
heard declare we unto you, that ye
also may have fellowship with us:
and truly our b fellowship is with
the c Father, and with his Son Jesus
Christ.
4 And these things a write we unto
you, that your joy may be full.
5 This then is the message which
we have heard of him, and declare
unto you, that God is a light, and in
him is no b darkness at all.
6 If we say that we have fellowship
with him, and a walk in b darkness,
we lie, and do not the truth:
7 But if we a walk in the light, as he
is in the light, we have fellowship
one with another, and the b blood
of Jesus Christ his Son c cleanseth
us from all sin.
8 If we say that we have a no b sin,
we c deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us.
9 If we a confess our sins, he is 
1 John 1:10–2:14 1556
faithful and b just to c forgive us our
sins, and to d cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
10 If we say that we have a not
sinned, we make him a liar, and his
word is not in us.
Chapter 2
Christ is our Advocate with the Father—
We know God by obedience—Love not
the world—Anti-Christs will come in
the last days.
My little children, these things write
I unto you, that ye sin not. a And if
any man sin, we have an b advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous:
2 And he is the a propitiation for
our sins: and not for ours only, but
also for the sins of the whole b world.
3 And hereby we do know that
we know him, if we a keep his commandments.
4 He that saith, I know him, and
keepeth not his a commandments, is
a b liar, and the truth is not in him.
5 But whoso a keepeth his word, in
him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are
b in him.
6 He that saith he a abideth in him
ought himself also so to b walk, even
as he walked.
7 a Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
commandment which ye had from
the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have
heard from the beginning.
8 Again, a new commandment
I write unto you, a which thing is
true in him and in you: because
the b darkness is c past, and the true d light now shineth.
9 He that saith he is in the light,
and hateth his brother, is in dark- ness even until now.
10 He that a loveth his b brother
abideth in the light, and there is
none occasion of stumbling in him.
11 But he that hateth his brother is
in darkness, and a walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he
goeth, because that darkness hath
blinded his eyes.
12 I a write unto you, little b children, because your sins are forgiven
you c for his d name’s sake.
13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is
from the beginning. I write unto
you, young men, because ye have
overcome the wicked one. I write
unto you, little children, because
ye have known the Father.
14 I have written unto you, fathers,
because ye have known him that is
from the beginning. I have written
unto you, young men, because ye

abideth in you, and ye have over- come the wicked one.
15 Love not the a world, neither the
things that are in the b world. If any
man love the world, the c love of the
Father is not in him.
16 For all that is in the world, the a lust of the flesh, and the lust of the
eyes, and the b pride of life, is not
of the Father, but is of the c world.
17 And the a world b passeth away,
and the lust thereof: but he that
doeth the c will of God d abideth
for ever.
18 Little children, it is the last time:
and as ye have heard that a antichrist
shall come, even now are there many
b antichrists; whereby we know that
it is the last time.
19 They went out from us, but
they were not of us; for if they had
been of us, they would no doubt have
continued with us: but they went
out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
20 But ye have an a unction from the b Holy One, and ye know all things.
21 I have not written unto you
because ye know not the truth,
but because ye know it, and that no
lie is of the truth.
22 Who is a a liar but he that de- nieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
b antichrist, that denieth the Father
and the Son.
23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the
same hath not the Father: [but] he
that a acknowledgeth the Son hath the
Father also.
24 Let that therefore abide in you,
which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard
from the a beginning shall remain
in you, ye also shall continue in the
Son, and in the Father.
25 And this is the a promise that he
hath promised us, even b eternal life.
26 These things have I written unto
you concerning them that a seduce
you.
27 But the anointing which ye have
received of him abideth in you, and
ye need not that any man a teach you:
but as the same b anointing c teacheth
you of all things, and is truth, and
is no lie, and even as it hath taught
you, ye shall abide in him.
28 And now, little children, abide
in him; that, when he shall ap- pear, we may have confidence, and
not be ashamed before him at his
coming.
29 If ye know that he is righteous,
ye know that every one that doeth
a righteousness is b born of him.
Chapter 3
The sons of God will become like
Christ—Love for others is required to
gain eternal life—Obedience ensures
us an answer to our prayers.
Behold, what manner of a love the
Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the b sons of
God: therefore the c world knoweth
us not, because it knew him not.
2 Beloved, now are we the a sons
of God, and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that,
when he shall b appear, we shall be

c like him; for we shall d see him as

3 And every man that hath this a hope in him b purifieth himself,
even as he is c pure.
4 Whosoever committeth sin a transgresseth also the law: for b sin is the
transgression of the law.
5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our a sins; and
in him is no sin.
6 Whosoever abideth in him a sinneth not: b whosoever sinneth hath
not seen him, neither c known him.
7 Little children, let no man de- ceive you: he that doeth righteous- ness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
8 He that a committeth b sin is of
the devil; for the devil c sinneth
from the beginning. For this pur- pose the Son of God was manifested,
that he might destroy the works of
the d devil.
9 Whosoever is a born of God b doth
not commit sin; for his seed re- maineth in him: and he cannot sin,
because he is born of God.
10 In this the children of God are a manifest, and the b children of the
devil: whosoever doeth not c righteousness is not of God, neither he
that loveth not his brother.
11 For this is the a message that ye
heard from the beginning, that we
should love one another.
12 Not as a Cain, who was of that
wicked one, and slew his brother.
And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and
his brother’s righteous.
13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the
world hate you.
14 We know that we have passed
from death unto a life, because we
love the b brethren. He that c loveth
not his brother abideth in d death.
15 Whosoever a hateth his brother
is a murderer: and ye know that no
b murderer hath eternal life abiding
in him.
16 Hereby perceive we the a love of b God, because he laid down his life
for us: and we ought to lay down
our lives for the brethren.
17 But whoso hath this world’s
good, and seeth his a brother have b need, and c shutteth up his bowels
of d compassion from him, how dwell- eth the love of God in him?
18 My little children, let us not love
in word, a neither in tongue; but in b deed and in truth.
19 And hereby we know that we
are of the truth, and shall assure
our hearts before him.

toward God.
22 And whatsoever we a ask, we
receive of him, because we b keep
his c commandments, and do those
things that are pleasing in his sight.
23 And this is his a command- ment, That we should b believe on
the c name of his Son Jesus Christ,
and d love one another, as he gave
us commandment.
24 And he that keepeth his com- mandments a dwelleth in him, and
he in him. And hereby we know

which he hath given us.
Chapter 4
Try the spirits—God is love and dwells
in those who love Him.
Beloved, believe not every a spirit,
but b try the c spirits whether they
are of God: because many d false
prophets are gone out into the world.
2 Hereby a know ye the b Spirit of
God: Every spirit that confesseth
that Jesus Christ is come in the
c flesh is of God:
3 And every spirit that confesseth
not that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh is a not of God: and this is that
spirit of b antichrist, whereof ye have
heard that it should come; and even
now already is it in the world.
4 Ye are of God, little children,
and have overcome them: because
greater is he that is in you, than he
that is in the world.
5 They are of the a world: therefore
speak they of the world, and the
world heareth them.
6 We are of God: he that knoweth
God a heareth us; he that is not of
God heareth not us. Hereby b know
we the c spirit of truth, and the spirit
of d error.
7 Beloved, let us a love one another:
for b love is of God; and every one
that loveth is c born of God, and
knoweth God.
8 He that loveth not a knoweth not
God; for God is love.
9 In this was manifested the love
of God toward us, because that God
sent his only begotten Son into the
world, that we might a live through
him.
10 Herein is love, not that we loved
God, but that he a loved us, and b sent
his Son to be the c propitiation for
our sins.
11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we
ought also to love one another.

in him, and he in us, because he
hath given us of his Spirit.
14 And we have seen and do a testify that the Father b sent the Son to
be the c Saviour of the d world.
15 Whosoever shall a confess that
Jesus is the Son of God, God dwell- eth in him, and he in God.
16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
God is love; and he that a dwelleth
in love dwelleth in God, and God
in him.
17 Herein is our love made perfect,
that we may have boldness in the
day of judgment: because as he a is,
so are we in this world.
18 There is no a fear in b love; but
perfect c love casteth out fear: because fear hath d torment. He that
feareth is not made perfect in love.
19 We a love him, because he first
loved us.
20 If a man say, I love God, and a hateth his b brother, he is a c liar: for
he that loveth not his d brother whom
he hath seen, how can he love God
whom he hath not e seen?
21 And this commandment have
we from him, That he who a loveth
God love his brother also.
Chapter 5
Saints are born of God through belief
in Christ—Water, blood, and the Spirit
testify of Christ—Belief in Christ is
required in order to gain eternal life.
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is
the Christ is born of God: and every
one that loveth him that begat loveth
him also that is begotten of him.
2 By this we know that we a love
the b children of God, when we love
God, and keep his commandments.
3 For this is the a love of God, that
we b keep his commandments: and
his commandments are not c grievous.
4 For whatsoever is a born of God b overcometh the world: and this is
the c victory that overcometh the
world, even our faith.
5 Who is he that a overcometh the
world, but he that believeth that
Jesus is the Son of God?
6 This is he that a came by water
and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by
water only, but by water and blood.
And it is the b Spirit that beareth c witness, because the Spirit is truth.
7 For there are three that bear
record in heaven, the a Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these
three are b one.
8 And there are three that bear
witness in earth, the a Spirit, and
the water, and the b blood: and these
three agree in one.
9 If we receive the a witness of men,
the b witness of God is greater: for
this is the c witness of God which he
hath testified of his Son.

the c record that God gave of his Son.
11 And this is the record, that God
hath given to us a eternal life, and
this b life is in his Son.
12 He that hath the Son hath life;
and he that hath not the Son of God
hath not life.
13 These things have I a written
unto you that believe on the name
of the Son of God; that ye may know
that ye have eternal b life, and that
ye may believe on the name of the
Son of God.
14 And this is the confidence that
we have in him, that, if we ask any
thing according to his a will, he b heareth us:
15 And if we know that he hear
us, whatsoever we a ask, we know
that we have the petitions that we
b desired of him.
16 If any man see his brother sin a
sin which is not unto death, he shall
ask, and he shall give him life for
them that sin not unto death. There
is a sin unto death: I do not say that
he shall pray for it.
17 All unrighteousness is a sin: and
there is a b sin not unto death.
18 We know that whosoever is a born of God b sinneth not; but he
that is begotten of God c keepeth himself, and that d wicked one toucheth
him not.
19 And we know that we are of a God, and the whole b world lieth
in c wickedness.
20 And we know that the Son of
God is come, and hath given us an
understanding, that we may know
him that is true, and we are in him
that is true, even in his Son Jesus
Christ. This is the true God, and

The Second Epistle of
John
John rejoices because the children of the
elect lady are true and faithful.
The elder unto the elect lady
and her children, whom I love
in the truth; and not I only,
but also all they that have known
the truth;
2 For the truth’s sake, which dwell­ eth in us, and shall be with us for
ever.
3 Grace be with you, mercy, and
peace, from God the Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
of the Father, in truth and love.
4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of 
2 John 1:5–3 John 1:9 1562
thy children walking in truth, as
we have received a commandment
from the Father.
5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not
as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we
had from the beginning, that we
love one another.
6 And this is a love, that we b walk
after his commandments. This is
the commandment, That, as ye
have heard from the c beginning, ye
should walk in it.
7 For many a deceivers are entered into the world, who confess
not that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
b antichrist.
8 Look to yourselves, that we lose
not those things which we have
a wrought, but that we receive a
full reward.
9 Whosoever transgresseth, and
abideth not in the doctrine of Christ,
hath not God. He that abideth in the
doctrine of Christ, he hath both the
Father and the Son.
10 If there come any unto you, and
bring not this doctrine, receive him
not into your a house, neither bid
him God speed:
11 For he that biddeth him God
speed is a partaker of his evil deeds.
12 Having many things to write
unto you, I would not a write with
paper and ink: but I trust to come
unto you, and speak face to face,
that our joy may be full.
13 The children of thy elect sister
greet thee. Amen.

The Third Epistle of
John
John commends Gaius for his help to
those who love the truth.
The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in
the truth.
2 Beloved, I wish above all things
that thou mayest prosper and be in
health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the
brethren came and testified of the
truth that is in thee, even as thou
walkest in the truth.
4 I have no greater a joy than to
hear that my b children c walk in
truth.
5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully
whatsoever thou doest to the a breth­ ren, and to b strangers;
6 Which have borne witness of thy
charity before the church: whom if
thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt
do well:
7 Because that for his name’s sake
they went forth, taking nothing of
the Gentiles.
8 We therefore ought to receive
such, that we might be fellowhelp­ ers to the truth.
9 I wrote unto the church: but
Diotrephes, who loveth to have the 
1563 3 JOHN 1:10–JUDE 1:6
a preeminence among them, b receiveth us not.
10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,
a prating against us with malicious
words: and not content therewith,
neither doth he himself receive the
brethren, and forbiddeth them that
would, and casteth them out of the
church.
11 Beloved, follow not that which
is evil, but that which is good. He
that doeth a  good is of God: but
he that doeth evil hath not seen
God.
12 Demetrius hath good report of
all men, and of the truth itself: yea,
and we also bear record; and ye know
that our a record is true.
13 I had many things to write, but
I will not with ink and pen a write
unto thee:
14 But I trust I shall shortly see
thee, and we shall speak face to face.
Peace be to thee. Our friends salute
thee. Greet the friends by name.

THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF
JUDE
Contend for the faith—Some angels kept
not their first estate—Michael disputed
about the body of Moses—Enoch prophesied of the Second Coming—Mockers
will come in the last days.
a J
UDE, the b servant of Jesus Christ,
and brother of James, to them
that are sanctified by God the
Father, and preserved in Jesus
Christ, and called:
2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and
love, be multiplied.
3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence
to a write unto you of the common b salvation, it was needful for me to
write unto you, and exhort you that
ye should c earnestly d contend for
the faith which was once delivered
unto the saints.
4 For there are certain a men crept
in unawares, who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation,
b ungodly men, turning the grace of
our God into c  lasciviousness, and d denying the only Lord God, and
our Lord Jesus Christ.
5 I will therefore put you in re- membrance, though ye once knew
this, how that the Lord, having
a saved the people out of the land of
Egypt, afterward b destroyed them
that c believed not.
6 And the a angels which kept not 
Jude 1:7–23 1564
their b first c estate, but left their
own habitation, he hath reserved in
everlasting chains under darkness
unto the d judgment of the great day.
7 Even as a Sodom and Gomorrha,
and the cities about them in like
manner, giving themselves over
to b fornication, and going after c strange flesh, are set forth for an
d example, suffering the e vengeance
of eternal fire.
8 Likewise also these a filthy dreamers b defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
9 Yet a Michael the b archangel,
when contending with the devil he
disputed about the body of c Moses,
durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord
rebuke thee.
10 But these speak evil of those
things which they know not: but
what they know naturally, as brute
beasts, in those things they corrupt
themselves.
11 Woe unto them! for they have
gone in the way of a Cain, and ran
greedily after the error of b Balaam
for reward, and c perished in the
gainsaying of Core.
12 These are spots in your feasts
of charity, when they feast with
you, feeding themselves without
fear: a clouds they are without water,
carried about of winds; trees whose
fruit withereth, without fruit, twice
dead, plucked up by the roots;
13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering a stars, to whom is reserved the
blackness of darkness for ever.
14 And a Enoch also, the seventh
from Adam, prophesied of these,
saying, Behold, the Lord b cometh
with ten thousands of his c saints,
15 To a execute b judgment upon
all, and to convince all that are
ungodly among them of all their
ungodly deeds which they have un- godly committed, and of all their
hard c speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
16 These are a murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
b lusts; and their mouth c speaketh
great swelling words, having men’s
persons in admiration because of
d advantage.
17 But, beloved, remember ye the
words which were spoken before
of the apostles of our Lord Jesus
Christ;
18 How that they told you there
should be a mockers in the b last time,
who should c walk after their own
ungodly lusts.
19 These be they who a separate
themselves, sensual, having not the
b Spirit.
20 But ye, beloved, a building up
yourselves on your most holy faith,
praying in the Holy Ghost,
21 Keep yourselves in the love of
God, looking for the mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
22 And of some have a compassion,

The Revelation
of St John the Divine
Chapter 1
Christ chooses some as kings and priests
unto God—Christ will come again—
John sees the risen Lord.
a The b Revelation of Jesus Christ,
which God gave unto him,
to shew unto his c servants
things which must d shortly come
to pass; and he sent and signified
it by his e angel unto his servant
John:
2 Who bare record of the word of
God, and of the testimony of Jesus
Christ, and of all things that he saw.
3 a Blessed is he that b readeth, and
they that hear the words of this
prophecy, and keep those things
which are written therein: for the
c time is at hand.
4
J
ohn to the a seven churches
which are in Asia: Grace be
unto you, and peace, from him
which b is, and which was, and
which is to come; and from the
seven c Spirits which are before his
throne;
5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the
faithful witness, and the a first begotten of the dead, and the prince
of the kings of the earth. Unto him
that loved us, and b washed us from
our sins in his own c blood,
6 And hath made us a kings and b priests unto God and his Father;
to him be c glory and d dominion for
ever and ever. Amen.
7 Behold, he a cometh with clouds;
and every eye shall b see him, and
they also which pierced him: and all c kindreds of the earth shall d wail
because of him. Even so, Amen.
8 I am a Alpha and Omega, the b beginning and the ending, saith the
Lord, which is, and which was, and
which is to come, the c Almighty.
9 I John, who also am your brother,
and companion in tribulation, and 
Revelation 1:10–2:2 1566
in the kingdom and a patience of
Jesus Christ, was in the isle that
is called Patmos, for the word of
God, and for the testimony of Jesus
Christ.
10 I was in the Spirit on the a Lord’s b day, and heard behind me a great
c voice, as of a trumpet,
11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega,
the a first and the last: and, What
thou seest, b write in a book, and send
it unto the seven churches which
are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto
Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and
unto c Thyatira, and unto Sardis,
and unto Philadelphia, and unto
d Laodicea.
12 And I turned to see the voice
that spake with me. And being
turned, I saw seven golden a candlesticks;
13 And in the midst of the seven
candlesticks one like unto the a Son
of man, b clothed with a garment
down to the foot, and girt about the
paps with a golden girdle.
14 His head and his hairs were white
like wool, as white as snow; and his
a eyes were as a flame of b fire;
15 And his feet like unto fine
brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his a voice as the sound
of many waters.
16 And he had in his right hand
seven stars: and out of his mouth
went a sharp twoedged a sword: and
his b countenance was as the c sun
shineth in his strength.
17 And when I a saw him, I fell at
his feet as dead. And he laid his
right hand upon me, saying unto me,
Fear not; I am the first and the last:
18 I am he that a liveth, and was b dead; and, behold, I am alive for
c evermore, Amen; and have the d keys
of e hell and of death.
19 a Write the things which thou
hast seen, and the things which
are, and the things which shall be
hereafter;
20 The mystery of the seven stars
which thou sawest in my right hand,
and the seven golden candlesticks.
The seven a stars are the b angels of
the seven churches: and the seven
c candlesticks which thou sawest are
the seven churches.
Chapter 2
He who overcomes will gain eternal
life, avoid the second death, inherit
the celestial kingdom, and rule many
kingdoms.
Unto the a angel of the church of
Ephesus b write; These things saith
he that holdeth the seven stars in
his right hand, who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candle- sticks;
2 I a know thy works, and thy la- bour, and thy patience, and how
thou canst not bear them which
are evil: and thou hast tried them
which say they are b apostles, and
are not, and hast found them liars:

3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast
laboured, and hast not fainted.
4 Nevertheless I have somewhat
against thee, because thou hast left
thy first a love.
5 Remember therefore from
whence thou art fallen, and repent,
and do the first works; or else I will
come unto thee quickly, and will
remove thy a candlestick out of his
place, except thou b repent.
6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the a Nicolaitans,
which I also hate.
7 He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the a Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that b overcometh
will I give to eat of the c tree of life,
which is in the midst of the d paradise of God.
8 And unto the angel of the church
in Smyrna write; These things saith
the first and the last, which was
dead, and is alive;
9 I know thy works, and tribu- lation, and poverty, (but thou art
rich) and I know the a blasphemy
of them which say they are Jews,
and are not, but are the synagogue
of Satan.
10 Fear none of those things which
thou shalt a suffer: behold, the devil
shall cast some of you into prison,
that ye may be b tried; and ye shall
have tribulation ten days: be thou
faithful unto c death, and I will d give
thee a e crown of life.
11 He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; He that overcometh shall
not be hurt of the second a death.
12 And to the angel of the church
in Pergamos write; These things
saith he which hath the sharp a sword
with two edges;
13 I know thy works, and where
thou dwellest, even where Satan’s
seat is: and thou holdest fast my
name, and hast not denied my faith,
even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful a martyr, who
was slain among you, where Satan
dwelleth.
14 But I have a few things against
thee, because thou hast there them
that hold the doctrine of a Balaam,
who taught Balac to cast a stum- blingblock before the children of
Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto
idols, and to commit b fornication.
15 So hast thou also them that
hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,
which thing I hate.
16 Repent; or else I will come unto
thee quickly, and will fight against
them with the sword of my mouth.
17 He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that a overcometh
will I give to eat of the hidden
b manna, and will give him a c white d stone, and in the stone a new e name
written, which no man knoweth
saving he that receiveth it.
18 And unto the a angel of the
church in b Thyatira write; These
things saith the Son of God, who
hath his c eyes like unto a flame of
fire, and his feet are like fine brass;
19 I know thy works, and charity,
and a service, and faith, and thy pa- tience, and thy works; and the last
to be more than the first.

20 Notwithstanding I have a few
things against thee, because thou
sufferest that woman Jezebel, which
calleth herself a prophetess, to teach
and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things
sacrificed unto idols.
21 And I gave her space to repent
of her fornication; and she repented
not.
22 Behold, I will cast her a into a
bed, and them that commit b adultery with her into great tribulation,
except they repent of their deeds.
23 And I will kill her children with
death; and all the churches shall
know that I am he which a searcheth
the b reins and hearts: and I will give
unto every one of you according to
your works.
24 But unto you I say, and unto
the rest in Thyatira, as many as
have not this doctrine, and which
have not known the depths of Sa- tan, as they speak; I will put upon
you none other burden.
25 But that which ye have already a hold fast till I come.
26 a And he that b overcometh, and
keepeth my works unto the end,
to him will I give c power over the
nations:
27 And he shall rule them with a a rod of iron; as the b vessels of a pot- ter shall they be broken to shivers:
even as I received of my Father.
28 And I will give him the morn- ing a star.
29 He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.
Chapter 3
He who overcomes will retain his
name in the book of life, reach god- hood, and be with Jesus as He is with
the Father.
a And unto the b angel of the church
in Sardis write; These things saith
he that hath the seven c Spirits of
God, and the seven d stars; I e know
thy works, that thou hast a name
that thou livest, and art f dead.
2 a Be watchful, and strengthen
the things which remain, that are
ready to die: for I have not found
thy works perfect before God.
3 Remember therefore how thou
hast received and heard, and hold
fast, and repent. If therefore thou
shalt not a watch, I will come on thee
as a b thief, and thou shalt not know
what hour I will come upon thee.
4 Thou hast a few names even in
Sardis which have not a defiled their
garments; and they shall b walk with
me in c white: for they are d worthy.
5 He that a overcometh, the same
shall be clothed in b white c raiment;
and I will not d blot out his name
out of the e book of life, but I will
f confess his name before my Father,
and before his angels.

1569 Revelation 3:8–4:1
in Philadelphia write; These things
saith he that is holy, he that is true,
he that hath the a key of David, he
that openeth, and no man shut- teth; and shutteth, and no man
openeth;
8 I know thy works: behold, I have
set before thee an open door, and
no man can shut it: for thou hast
a little strength, and hast kept my
word, and hast not denied my name.
9 Behold, I will make them of the
synagogue of Satan, which say they
are Jews, and are not, but do lie;
behold, I will make them to come
and a worship before thy feet, and
to know that I have loved thee.
10 Because thou hast kept the word
of my patience, I also will a keep
thee from the hour of b temptation,
which shall come upon all the world,
to try them that dwell upon the
earth.
11 Behold, I come a quickly: hold
that fast which thou hast, that no
man take thy crown.
12 Him that overcometh will I make
a pillar in the temple of my God,
and he shall go no more out: and I
will write upon him the a name of
my God, and the name of the city
of my God, which is b new Jerusalem,
which cometh down out of heaven
from my God: and I will write upon
him my new name.
13 He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.
14 And unto the angel of the church
of the Laodiceans write; These things
saith the Amen, the a faithful and
true witness, the b beginning of the c creation of God;
15 I know thy a works, that thou art
neither cold nor hot: I would thou
wert cold or hot.
16 So then because thou art a lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
will b spue thee out of my mouth.
17 Because thou sayest, I am a rich,
and increased with goods, and
have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind,
and naked:
18 I a counsel thee to buy of me b gold tried in the fire, that thou
mayest be rich; and white raiment,
that thou mayest be clothed, and
that the shame of thy nakedness do
not appear; and anoint thine eyes
with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
19 As many as I love, I rebuke and a chasten: be zealous therefore, and
repent.
20 Behold, I stand at the door, and
knock: if any man hear my voice,
and a open the door, I will b come in
to him, and will sup with him, and
he with me.
21 To him that a overcometh will I
grant to b sit with me in my c throne,
even as I also overcame, and am set
down with my Father in his throne.
22 He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.

John sees the celestial earth, the throne

After this I looked, and, behold, a

will a shew thee things which must

2 And immediately I was in the
spirit: and, behold, a throne was set
in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
3 And he that sat was to look upon
like a jasper and a sardine stone:
and there was a a rainbow round
about the throne, in sight like unto
an emerald.
4 a And round about the throne were
four and twenty b seats: and upon
the seats I saw four and twenty c elders sitting, clothed in white rai- ment; and they had on their heads
crowns of gold.
5 And out of the throne proceeded
lightnings and thunderings and
voices: and there were seven lamps
of fire burning before the throne,
which are the a seven b Spirits of God.
6 And before the throne there was a a sea of glass like unto crystal: b and in
the midst of the throne, and round
about the throne, were four c beasts
full of eyes before and behind.
7 And the first beast was like a
lion, and the second beast like a calf,
and the third beast had a face as a
man, and the fourth beast was like
a flying eagle.
8 And the four beasts had each of
them six wings about him; and they
were full of eyes within: and they
rest not day and night, saying, Holy,
holy, holy, a Lord God b Almighty,
which was, and is, and is to come.
9 And when those beasts give glory
and honour and thanks to him that
sat on the throne, who liveth for
ever and ever,
10 The four and twenty elders fall
down before him that sat on the
throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their
crowns before the throne, saying,
11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power:
for thou hast a created all things,
and b for thy pleasure they are and
were created.
Chapter 5
John sees the book sealed with seven
seals, and he sees those people redeemed
out of every nation—He hears every
creature praising God and the Lamb.
And I saw in the right hand of him
that sat on the throne a book a writ- ten within and on the backside,
b sealed with seven c seals.
2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
a worthy to open the book, and to
loose the seals thereof?
3 And no man in heaven, nor in
earth, neither under the earth, was
able to open the book, neither to
look thereon.
4 And I wept much, because no
man was found worthy to open
and to read the book, neither to
look thereon.
5 And one of the elders saith unto
me, Weep not: behold, the a Lion
of the tribe of b Juda, the c Root of
David, hath prevailed to open the
book, and to loose the seven seals
thereof.
6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst
of the throne and of the four beasts,
and in the midst of the elders, stood
a a Lamb as it had been slain, b having

forth into all the earth.
7 And he came and took the book
out of the right hand of him that
sat upon the throne.
8 And when he had taken the book,
the four beasts and four and twenty
elders fell down before the Lamb,
having every one of them harps, and
golden vials full of a odours, which
are the b prayers of saints.
9 And they a sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
book, and to open the seals thereof:
for thou wast slain, and hast b re- deemed us to God by thy blood out
of every c kindred, and tongue, and
people, and nation;
10 And hast made us unto our God
kings and a priests: and we shall
reign on the earth.
11 And I beheld, and I heard the
voice of many angels round about
the throne and the beasts and the
elders: and the number of them was
ten thousand times ten thousand,
and a thousands of thousands;
12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the a Lamb that was slain to
receive b power, and riches, and c wis- dom, and strength, and honour, and
glory, and blessing.
13 And every a creature which is in
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the
sea, and all that are in them, heard
I saying, Blessing, and honour, and
glory, and b power, be unto him that
sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb for ever and ever.
14 And the four beasts said, Amen.
And the four and twenty elders fell
down and worshipped him that liv- eth for ever and ever.
Chapter 6
Christ opens the six seals, and John sees
the events therein—In the fifth seal,
he sees the Christian martyrs; and in
the sixth, he sees the signs of the times.
a And I saw when the Lamb opened
one of the b seals, and I heard, as it
were the noise of thunder, one of the
four c beasts saying, Come and see.
2 And I saw, and behold a white
horse: and he that sat on him had
a bow; and a crown was given unto
him: and he went forth conquering,
and to conquer.
3 And when he had opened the a second seal, I heard the second
beast say, Come and see.
4 And there went out another horse
that was red: and power was given to
him that sat thereon to take a peace
from the earth, and that they should
kill one another: and there was given
unto him a great sword.
5 And when he had opened the
third seal, I heard the third beast
say, Come and see. And I beheld,
and lo a black horse; and he that
sat on him had a pair of balances
in his hand.
6 And I heard a voice in the midst
of the four beasts say, A measure of
wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see
thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
7 And when he had opened the
fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
fourth beast say, Come and see.
8 And I looked, and behold a pale
horse: and his name that sat on him
was Death, and Hell followed with
him. And power was given unto
them over the fourth part of the
earth, to kill with a sword, and with
hunger, and with death, and with
the beasts of the earth.

9 And when he had opened the
fifth seal, I saw under the a altar
the souls of them that were b slain
for the word of God, and for the
testimony which they held:
10 And they cried with a loud
voice, saying, How long, O Lord,
holy and true, dost thou not judge
and a avenge our blood on them that
dwell on the earth?
11 And a white b robes were given
unto every one of them; and it was
said unto them, that they should
c rest yet for a little season, until
their fellowservants also and their
brethren, that should be killed as
they were, should be fulfilled.
12 And I beheld when he had
opened the a sixth seal, and, lo,
there was a great b earthquake; and
the c sun became d black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became
as e blood;
13 And the stars of heaven fell
unto the earth, even as a fig tree
casteth her a untimely figs, when she
is shaken of a mighty wind.
14 a And the heaven departed as a b scroll when it is rolled together; and
every c mountain and island were
moved out of their places.
15 And the a kings of the earth, and
the great men, and the rich men, and
the chief captains, and the mighty
men, and every bondman, and every
free man, hid themselves in the b dens
and in the rocks of the mountains;
16 And said to the a mountains and
rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from
the face of him that sitteth on the
throne, and from the wrath of the
Lamb:
17 For the great a day of his wrath
is come; and who shall be able to
b stand?
Chapter 7
John also sees in the sixth seal the Restoration of the gospel, the sealing of the
144,000, and the hosts of the exalted
from all nations.
And after these things I saw four a angels standing on the four cor- ners of the earth, holding the four
b winds of the earth, that the wind
should not blow on the earth, nor
on the sea, nor on any tree.
2 And I saw another angel a ascending from the east, having the b seal
of the living God: and he cried with
a loud voice to the four angels, to
whom it was given to hurt the earth
and the sea,
3 Saying, a Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we
have b sealed the c servants of our
God in their foreheads.
4 And I heard the number of them
which were sealed: and there were
sealed an a hundred and forty and
four thousand of all the b tribes of
the children of c Israel.
5 Of the tribe of a Juda were sealed
twelve thousand. Of the tribe of

9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a
great multitude, which no man
could number, of all nations, and
a kindreds, and people, and tongues,
stood before the throne, and before
the Lamb, clothed with white robes,
and b palms in their hands;
10 And cried with a loud voice,
saying, Salvation to our God which
sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb.
11 And all the angels stood round
about the throne, and about the elders and the four a beasts, and fell
before the throne on their faces,
and worshipped God,
12 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and
glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and
might, be unto our God for ever and
ever. Amen.
13 And one of the elders answered,
saying unto me, What are these
which are arrayed in white robes?
and whence came they ?
14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou
knowest. And he said to me, These
are they which came a out of great b tribulation, and have c washed their
robes, and made them d white in the e blood of the f Lamb.
15 Therefore are they before the
throne of God, and serve him day
and night in his a temple: and he that b sitteth on the throne shall c dwell
among them.
16 They shall hunger no more, neither a thirst any more; neither shall
the b sun light on them, nor any heat.
17 For the Lamb which is in the
midst of the throne shall feed them,
and shall lead them unto living
fountains of a waters: and God shall
wipe away all b tears from their eyes.
Chapter 8
John sees fire and desolation poured out
during the seventh seal and preceding
the Second Coming.
And when he had a opened the b seventh seal, there was c silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
2 And I saw the seven angels which
stood before God; and to them were
given seven a trumpets.
3 And another angel came and
stood at the altar, having a golden
censer; and there was given unto
him much a incense, that he should
offer it with the prayers of all saints
upon the golden altar which was
before the throne.
4 And the smoke of the incense,
which came with the a prayers of the
saints, ascended up before God out
of the angel’s hand.
5 And the angel took the censer,
and filled it with fire of the altar,
and a cast it into the earth: and there
were b voices, and thunderings, and
lightnings, and an earthquake.
6 And the seven angels which had
the seven a trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
7 The first angel sounded, and there
followed hail and a fire mingled with

9 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and
had life, died; and the third part of
the ships were destroyed.
10 And the third angel sounded,
and there a fell a great star from
heaven, burning as it were a lamp,
and it fell upon the third part of
the rivers, and upon the fountains
of waters;
11 And the name of the star is
called Wormwood: and the third part
of the waters became wormwood;
and many men died of the waters,
because they were made bitter.
12 And the fourth angel sounded,
and the third part of the sun was
smitten, and the third part of
the moon, and the third part of the
stars; so as the third part of them
was darkened, and the day shone
not for a third part of it, and the
night likewise.
13 And I beheld, and heard an a angel flying through the midst of
heaven, saying with a loud voice,
b Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters
of the earth by reason of the other
voices of the trumpet of the three
angels, which are yet to sound!
Chapter 9
John also sees the wars and plagues
poured out during the seventh seal and
before the Lord comes.
And the fifth angel sounded, and
I saw a star fall from heaven unto
the earth: a and to him was given the
key of the b bottomless c pit.
2 And he opened the bottomless
pit; and there arose a smoke out of
the pit, as the smoke of a great fur- nace; and the sun and the air were
darkened by reason of the smoke
of the pit.
3 And there came out of the smoke
locusts upon the earth: and unto
them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
4 And it was commanded them that
they should not hurt the grass of the
earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those a men
which have not the b seal of God in
their foreheads.
5 And to them it was given that
they should not kill them, but
that they should be tormented five
months: and their torment was
as the torment of a scorpion, when
he striketh a man.
6 And in those days shall men seek a death, and shall not find it; and
shall desire to die, and death shall
flee from them.
7 And the shapes of the locusts
were like unto horses prepared unto
battle; and on their heads were as
it were crowns like gold, and their
faces were as the faces of men.
8 And they had hair as the hair of
women, and their teeth were as the a teeth of lions.
9 And they had breastplates, as
it were breastplates of iron; and
the sound of their wings was as the a sound of chariots of many horses
running to battle.
10 And they had tails like unto
scorpions, and there were stings in
their tails: and their power was to
hurt men five months.
11 And they had a king over them,
which is the angel of the bottomless
pit, whose name in the Hebrew
tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek
tongue hath his name Apollyon.
12 One woe is past; and, behold,
there come two woes more hereafter.

and I heard a voice from the four
horns of the golden altar which is
before God,
14 Saying to the sixth angel which
had the trumpet, Loose the four an- gels which are bound a in the great
river Euphrates.
15 And the four angels were loosed,
which were prepared for an hour,
and a day, and a month, and a year,
for to slay the third part of men.
16 And the a number of the army
of the horsemen were two hundred
thousand thousand: and I heard the
number of them.
17 And thus I saw the horses in the
vision, and them that sat on them,
having breastplates of fire, and of
jacinth, and brimstone: and the
heads of the horses were as the heads
of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
18 By these three was the third
part of men killed, by the fire, and
by the smoke, and by the brimstone,
which issued out of their mouths.
19 For their power is in their
mouth, and in their tails: for their
tails were like unto serpents, and had
heads, and with them they do hurt.
20 And the rest of the men which
were not killed by these plagues yet
repented not of the works of their
hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and
silver, and brass, and stone, and of
wood: which neither can see, nor
hear, nor walk:
21 Neither repented they of their a murders, nor of their b sorceries,
nor of their fornication, nor of their
thefts.
Chapter 10
John seals up many things relative to the
last days—He is commissioned to participate in the restoration of all things.
And I saw another mighty angel
come down from heaven, clothed
with a cloud: and a rainbow was
upon his head, and his face was as
it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
2 And he had in his hand a little a book open: and he set his right
foot upon the sea, and his left foot
on the earth,
3 And cried with a loud voice, as
when a lion roareth: and when he
had cried, seven thunders uttered
their voices.
4 And when the seven thunders
had uttered their voices, I was about
to write: and I heard a voice from
heaven saying unto me, Seal up
those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
5 And the angel which I saw a stand
upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven,
6 And a sware by him that liveth for
ever and ever, who created heaven,
and the things that therein are,
and the earth, and the things that
therein are, and the sea, and the
things which are therein, that there
should be b time no longer:
7 But in the days of the voice of
the seventh angel, when he shall
begin to sound, the a mystery of God
should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
8 And the voice which I heard
from heaven spake unto me again,
and said, Go and take the little book
which is open in the hand of the
angel which standeth upon the sea
and upon the earth.
9 And I went unto the angel, and
said unto him, Give me the little
book. And he said unto me, Take
it, and eat it up; and it shall make
thy belly bitter, but it shall be in
thy mouth sweet as honey.
10 And I took the little book out
of the angel’s hand, and a ate it up;
and it was in my mouth sweet as
honey: and as soon as I had eaten
it, my belly was bitter.

and kings.
Chapter 11
In the last days, two prophets will be
slain in Jerusalem—After 3½ days,
they will be resurrected—Christ will
reign over all the earth.
And there was given me a a reed like
unto a rod: b and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and c measure the temple
of God, and the d altar, and them
that worship therein.
2 But the court which is without
the temple leave out, and measure it
not; for it is given unto the Gentiles:
and the a holy city shall they tread
under foot forty and two months.
3 And I will give a power unto my two b witnesses, and they shall prophesy
a thousand two hundred and three- score days, clothed in sackcloth.
4 These are the two olive trees,
and the two candlesticks standing
before the God of the earth.
5 And if any man will hurt them,
fire proceedeth out of their mouth,
and devoureth their enemies: and
if any man will hurt them, he must
in this manner be killed.
6 These have power to shut heaven,
that it rain not in the days of their
prophecy: and have power over waters to a turn them to blood, and to
smite the earth with all b plagues,
as often as they will.
7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit
shall make war against them, and
shall a overcome them, and b kill
them.
8 And their dead bodies shall lie in
the street of the great city, which
spiritually is called Sodom and
Egypt, where also our Lord was
a crucified.
9 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall
see their dead bodies three days and
an half, and shall not suffer their
dead bodies to be put in graves.
10 And they that dwell upon the
earth shall rejoice over them, and
make merry, and shall send gifts
one to another; because these two
prophets tormented them that dwelt
on the earth.
11 And after three days and an half
the Spirit of life from God entered
into them, and they stood upon their
feet; and great fear fell upon them
which saw them.
12 And they heard a great voice
from heaven saying unto them,
Come up hither. And they ascended
up to heaven in a cloud; and their
enemies beheld them.
13 And the same hour was there
a great a earthquake, and the tenth
part of the city fell, and in the
earthquake were slain of men seven
thousand: and the remnant were af- frighted, and gave glory to the God of
heaven.
14 The second woe is past; and, be- hold, the third woe cometh quickly.
15 And the seventh angel sounded;
and there were great voices in
heaven, saying, The a kingdoms of
this world are become the b kingdoms
of our Lord, and of his c Christ; and
he shall d reign for ever and ever.

hast taken to thee thy great power,
and hast reigned.
18 And the nations were angry,
and thy wrath is come, and the
time of the dead, that they should
be a judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants
the prophets, and to the saints, and
them that fear thy name, small and
great; and shouldest destroy them
which b destroy the earth.
19 And the temple of God was
opened in heaven, and there was
seen in his temple the a ark of his

and an earthquake, and great b hail.
Chapter 12
John sees the imminent apostasy of
the Church—He also sees the War in
Heaven in the beginning when Satan
was cast out—He sees the continuation
of that war on earth.
a And there appeared a great wonder
in heaven; a b woman clothed with
the sun, and the moon under her
feet, and upon her head a crown
of twelve stars:
2 And she being with a child cried,
travailing in birth, and pained to
be delivered.
3 And there appeared another won- der in heaven; and behold a great
red dragon, having seven heads and
ten horns, and seven crowns upon
his heads.
4 And his tail drew the a third part
of the stars of heaven, and did cast
them to the earth: and the dragon
stood before the woman which was
ready to be delivered, for to devour
her child as soon as it was born.
5 And she brought forth a man
child, who was to rule all nations
with a a rod of iron: and her child
was caught up unto God, and to his
throne.
6 And the a woman fled into the
wilderness, where she hath a place
prepared of God, that they should
feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
7 And there was a war in heaven: b Michael and his c angels fought
against the dragon; and the d dragon
fought and his angels,
8 And prevailed not; neither was
their place found any more in
a heaven.
9 And the great dragon was a cast
out, that old serpent, called the
b Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth
the whole world: he was cast out
into the earth, and his angels were
cast out with him.
10 And I heard a loud a voice saying
in heaven, Now is come salvation,
and b strength, and the kingdom of
our God, and the c power of his Christ:
for the d accuser of our brethren is
cast down, which accused them be- fore our God day and night.
11 And they a overcame him by the
blood of the Lamb, and by the word
of their b testimony; and they loved
not their lives unto the c death.
12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens,
and ye that dwell in them. Woe to
the inhabiters of the earth and of the
sea! for the devil is come down unto
you, having great wrath, because he

knoweth that he hath but a short

13 And when the dragon saw that
he was cast unto the earth, he a persecuted the woman which brought
forth the man child.
14 And to the woman were given
two wings of a great eagle, that she
might fly into the wilderness, into
her place, where she is nourished
for a time, and times, and half a
time, from the face of the serpent.
15 And the serpent cast out of his
mouth water as a flood after the
woman, that he might cause her to
be carried away of the flood.
16 And the earth helped the woman,
and the earth opened her mouth,
and swallowed up the flood which
the dragon cast out of his mouth.
17 And the a dragon was wroth
with the woman, and went to make

which keep the commandments of
God, and have the testimony of Jesus
Christ.
Chapter 13
John sees fierce-looking beasts that
represent degenerate earthly kingdoms
controlled by Satan—The devil works
miracles and deceives men.
a And I stood upon the sand of the
sea, and saw a beast rise up out of
the b sea, having seven heads and
ten horns, and upon his horns ten
crowns, and upon his heads the
name of blasphemy.
2 And the beast which I saw was
like unto a leopard, and his feet
were as the feet of a bear, and his
mouth as the mouth of a lion: and
the dragon gave him his a power,
and his seat, and great authority.
3 And I saw one of his heads as
it were wounded to death; and his
deadly wound was healed: and all
the world wondered after the beast.
4 And they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the a beast:
and they b worshipped the beast,
saying, Who is like unto the beast?
who is able to make war with him?
5 And there was given unto him a a mouth speaking great things and
b blasphemies; and power was given
unto him to continue forty and two
months.
6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
his a name, and his tabernacle, and
them that dwell in heaven.
7 And it was given unto him to
make war with the saints, and to
overcome them: and a power was
given him over all kindreds, and
tongues, and nations.
8 And all that dwell upon the earth
shall worship him, whose names are
not written in the a book of life of
the b Lamb slain from the c founda- tion of the world.
9 If any man have an ear, let him
hear.
10 He that leadeth into captivity
shall go into captivity: he that a kil- leth with the sword must be killed
with the sword. Here is the b patience
and the faith of the c saints.
11 And I beheld another beast
coming up out of the earth; and he
had two horns like a lamb, and
he spake as a dragon.
12 And he exerciseth all the power
of the first beast before him, and
causeth the earth and them which
dwell therein to worship the first
beast, whose deadly wound was
healed.
13 And he doeth great wonders, so
that he maketh fire come down from

heaven on the earth in the sight
of men,
14 And a deceiveth them that dwell
on the earth by the means of those b miracles which he had power to do
in the sight of the beast; saying to
them that dwell on the earth, that
they should make an image to the
beast, which had the wound by a
sword, and did live.
15 And he had power to give life
unto the image of the beast, that
the image of the beast should both
speak, and cause that as many as
would not worship the image of the
beast should be killed.
16 And he causeth all, both small
and great, rich and poor, free and
bond, to receive a mark in their
right hand, or in their foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or
sell, save he that had the mark, or
the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
18 Here is a wisdom. Let him that
hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six
hundred threescore and six.
Chapter 14
The Lamb will stand upon Mount
Zion—The gospel will be restored in the
last days by angelic ministry—The Son
of Man will harvest the earth.
And I looked, and, lo, a a Lamb stood
on the mount b Sion, and with him
an hundred forty and four thousand,
having his Father’s c name written
in their foreheads.
2 And I heard a voice from heaven,
as the voice of many waters, and as
the voice of a great thunder: and I
heard the voice of harpers harping
with their harps:
3 And they sung as it were a new a song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders:
and no man could learn that song
but the hundred and forty and four
thousand, which were redeemed
from the earth.
4 These are they which were not
defiled with a women; for they are
virgins. These are they which follow
the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.
These were b redeemed from among
men, being the firstfruits unto God
and to the Lamb.
5 And in their mouth was found
no a guile: for they are without fault
before the throne of God.
6 And I saw another a angel fly
in the midst of heaven, having the
b everlasting c gospel to d preach unto
them that dwell on the earth, and
to every e nation, and kindred, and
tongue, and people,
7 Saying with a loud voice, a Fear
God, and give glory to him; for the
hour of his b judgment is come: and c worship d him that made e heaven,
and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
8 And there followed another an- gel, saying, a Babylon is b fallen, is
fallen, that great c city, because she
made all nations drink of the wine
of the wrath of her d fornication.
9 And the third angel followed
them, saying with a loud voice, If

image, and receive his mark in his
forehead, or in his hand,

of the wrath of God, which is a poured
out without mixture into the cup of
his b indignation; and he shall be
tormented with fire and brimstone
in the presence of the holy angels,
and in the presence of the Lamb:
11 And the smoke of their torment
ascendeth up for ever and ever: and
they have no rest day nor night, who
worship the beast and his image,
and whosoever receiveth the mark
of his name.
12 Here is the a patience of the
saints: here are they that keep
the commandments of God, and
the faith of Jesus.
13 And I heard a voice from heaven
saying unto me, Write, a Blessed are
the b dead which c die in the Lord
from henceforth: Yea, saith the
Spirit, that they may d rest from
their labours; and their works do
follow them.
14 And I looked, and behold a white
cloud, and upon the cloud one sat
like unto the a Son of man, having
on his head a golden crown, and in
his hand a sharp sickle.
15 And another angel came out
of the temple, crying with a loud
voice to him that sat on the cloud,
a Thrust in thy sickle, and b reap: for
the time is come for thee to reap;
for the c harvest of the earth is d ripe.
16 And he that sat on the cloud
thrust in his sickle on the earth;
and the earth was reaped.
17 And another angel came out of
the temple which is in heaven, he
also having a sharp sickle.
18 And another angel came out
from the altar, which had power
over fire; and cried with a loud cry
to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and
gather the clusters of the a vine of the
earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
19 And the angel thrust in his
sickle into the earth, and gathered
the vine of the earth, and cast it into
the great a winepress of the wrath
of God.
20 And the winepress was trodden
without the city, and blood came
out of the winepress, even unto
the horse bridles, by the space of a
thousand and six hundred furlongs.
Chapter 15
Exalted Saints praise God in celestial
glory forever.
And I saw another sign in heaven,
great and marvellous, seven angels
having the seven last a plagues; for in
them is filled up the wrath of God.
2 And I saw as it were a a sea of b glass mingled with fire: and them
that had gotten the victory over the
beast, and over his image, and over
his mark, and over the number of
his name, stand on the sea of glass,
having the harps of God.
3 And they a sing the song of Moses
the servant of God, and the song
of the Lamb, saying, b Great and
marvellous are thy works, Lord God
Almighty; c just and true are thy
ways, thou King of d saints.
4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord,
and glorify thy a name? for thou only
art holy: for all nations shall come
and worship before thee; for thy
judgments are made manifest.
5 And after that I looked, and, be- hold, the temple of the tabernacle of
the a testimony in heaven was opened:

7 And one of the four beasts gave
unto the seven angels seven golden
vials full of the wrath of God, who
liveth for ever and ever.
8 And the temple was filled with
smoke from the glory of God, and
from his power; and no man was
able to enter into the temple, till
the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
Chapter 16
God pours out plagues upon the wicked—
The nations assemble for Armaged- don—Christ comes, islands flee, and
mountains cease.
And I heard a great voice out of
the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out
the vials of the wrath of God upon
the earth.
2 And the first went, and poured
out his vial upon the earth; and
there fell a a noisome and grievous
sore upon the men which had the
mark of the beast, and upon them
which worshipped his image.
3 And the second angel poured out
his vial upon the sea; and it became
as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.
4 And the third angel poured out
his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became
blood.
5 And I heard the angel of the wa- ters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord,
which art, and wast, and shalt be,
because thou hast a judged thus.
6 For they have a shed the b blood
of saints and prophets, and thou
hast given them blood to drink; for
they are c worthy.
7 And I heard another out of
the altar say, Even so, Lord God
Almighty, true and righteous are
thy judgments.
8 And the fourth angel poured out
his vial upon the sun; and power
was given unto him to scorch men
with fire.
9 And men were scorched with
great heat, and a blasphemed the
name of God, which hath power over
these plagues: and they repented
not to give him glory.
10 And the fifth angel poured out
his vial upon the seat of the beast;
and his kingdom was full of a darkness; and they gnawed their tongues
for pain,
11 And blasphemed the God of
heaven because of their a pains and
their sores, and repented not of
their deeds.
12 And the sixth angel poured out
his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried
up, that the way of the kings of the
east might be prepared.
13 And I saw three unclean spirits
like frogs come out of the mouth of
the dragon, and out of the mouth
of the beast, and out of the mouth of
the a false prophet.
14 For they are the a spirits of b devils, working c miracles, which go forth
unto the kings of the earth and of
the whole world, to gather them to
the d battle of that great day of God
Almighty.
15 Behold, I come as a a thief.
Blessed is he that b watcheth, and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk
naked, and they see his shame.
16 And he gathered them together
into a place called in the Hebrew
tongue a Armageddon.
17 And the seventh angel poured
out his vial into the air; and there
came a great voice out of the temple
of heaven, from the throne, saying,
It is done.

18 And there were voices, and

was a great a earthquake, such as
was not since men were upon the
earth, so mighty an earthquake, and
so great.
19 And the great city was divided
into three parts, and the cities of
the nations fell: and great a Babylon
came in remembrance before God,
to give unto her the cup of the wine
of the fierceness of his b wrath.
20 And every island fled away,
and the a mountains were not found.
21 And there fell upon men a great a hail out of heaven, every stone about
the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague
of the hail; for the plague thereof
was exceeding great.
Chapter 17
John is shown that Babylon the great,
the mother of harlots and abominations, has become established throughout the earth.
And there came one of the seven
angels which had the seven vials,
and talked with me, saying unto me,
Come hither; I will shew unto thee
the a judgment of the great b whore
that sitteth upon many c waters:
2 With whom the kings of the earth
have committed fornication, and
the a inhabitants of the earth have
been made drunk with the wine of
her b fornication.
3 So he carried me away in the
spirit into the wilderness: and I
saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
coloured beast, full of a names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and
ten horns.
4 And the woman was arrayed
in purple and scarlet colour, and
decked with gold and precious stones
and pearls, having a golden cup in
her hand a full of abominations and b filthiness of her fornication:
5 And upon her forehead was a
name written, a Mystery, b Babylon the Great, the c Mother
of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.
6 And I saw the woman drunken
with the a blood of the saints, and with
the blood of the b martyrs of Jesus:
and when I saw her, I wondered
with great c admiration.
7 And the angel said unto me,
Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
tell thee the mystery of the woman,
and of the beast that carrieth her,
which hath the seven heads and
ten horns.
8 The beast that thou sawest was,
and is not; and shall ascend out of
the bottomless pit, and go into a perdition: and they that dwell on the
earth shall wonder, whose names
were not written in the b book of life
from the foundation of the world,
when they behold the beast that
was, and is not, and yet is.
9 And here is the a mind which
hath wisdom. The seven heads are
seven mountains, on which the
woman sitteth.
10 And there are seven a kings: five
are fallen, and one is, and the other is
not yet come; and when he cometh,
he must continue a short space.
11 And the beast that was, and
is not, even he is the eighth, and is
of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

receive power as kings one hour
with the beast.
13 These have one mind, and shall
give their power and strength unto
the beast.
14 These shall make a war with the
Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
them: for he is b Lord of lords, and c King of kings: and they that are
with him are called, and chosen,
and faithful.
15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
16 And the ten horns which thou
sawest upon the beast, these shall
hate the a whore, and shall make
her desolate and naked, and shall
eat her flesh, and b burn her with
fire.
17 For God hath put in their hearts
to fulfil his will, and to agree, and

Chapter 18
The Saints are called out of Babylon
lest they partake of her sins—She falls
and is lamented by her supporters.
And after these things I saw another
angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was
a lightened with his glory.
2 And he cried mightily with a
strong voice, saying, a Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and
the b hold of every foul spirit, and
a c cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
3 For all nations have drunk of
the wine of the wrath of her a fornication, and the kings of the earth
have committed b fornication with
her, and the merchants of the earth
are waxed rich through the c abundance of her delicacies.
4 And I heard another voice from
heaven, saying, a Come b out of her,
my people, that ye be not partakers of her c sins, and that ye receive
not of her plagues.
5 For her a sins have reached unto
heaven, and God hath remembered
her iniquities.
6 a Reward her even as she re- warded you, and double unto her
double according to her works: in
the cup which she hath filled fill
to her double.
7 How much she hath glorified
herself, and lived a deliciously, so
much torment and sorrow give her:
for she saith in her heart, I sit a
queen, and am no widow, and shall
see no sorrow.
8 Therefore shall her a plagues come
in one day, death, and mourning,
and famine; and she shall be utterly
b burned with fire: for strong is the
Lord God who c judgeth her.
9 And the kings of the earth, who
have committed fornication and
lived deliciously with her, shall
a bewail her, and lament for her,
when they shall see the b smoke of
her burning,
10 Standing afar off for the fear
of her torment, saying, Alas, alas,
that great city Babylon, that mighty
city! for in one hour is thy judgment
come.

11 And the merchants of the earth
shall weep and mourn over her; for
no man buyeth their merchandise
any more:
12 The merchandise of gold, and
silver, and precious stones, and of
pearls, and fine linen, and purple,
and silk, and scarlet, and all thy- ine wood, and all manner vessels
of ivory, and all manner vessels of
most precious wood, and of brass,
and iron, and marble,
13 And cinnamon, and odours, and
ointments, and frankincense, and
wine, and oil, and fine flour, and
wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and
horses, and chariots, and a slaves,
and souls of men.
14 And the fruits that thy soul a lusted after are departed from thee,
and all things which were dainty and
goodly are departed from thee, and
thou shalt find them no more at all.
15 The merchants of these things,
which were made rich by her, shall
stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
16 And saying, Alas, alas, that great
city, that was clothed in fine linen,
and purple, and scarlet, and decked
with gold, and precious stones, and
pearls!
17 For in one hour so great riches
is come to nought. And every ship- master, and all the company in ships,
and sailors, and as many as trade
by sea, stood afar off,
18 And cried when they saw the
smoke of her burning, saying, What
city is like unto this great city!
19 And they cast a dust on their
heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great
city, wherein were made rich all
that had ships in the sea by reason
of her costliness! for in one hour is
she made desolate.
20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven,
and ye holy apostles and prophets;
for God hath avenged you on her.
21 And a mighty angel took up a
stone like a great millstone, and cast
it into the sea, saying, Thus with
violence shall that great city a Babylon be thrown down, and shall be
found no more at all.
22 And the voice of harpers, and
musicians, and of pipers, and trum- peters, shall be heard no more at all
in thee; and no craftsman, of what- soever craft he be, shall be found
any more in thee; and the sound of
a millstone shall be heard no more
at all in thee;
23 And the light of a candle shall
shine no more at all in thee; and
the a voice of the bridegroom and
of the bride shall be heard no more
at all in thee: for thy merchants
were the great men of the earth; for
by thy b sorceries were all nations
deceived.
24 And in her was found the a blood
of prophets, and of saints, and of
all that were slain upon the earth.
Chapter 19
The marriage supper of the Lamb is

And after these things I heard a great

and honour, and power, unto the
Lord our God:
2 For true and righteous are his a judgments: for he hath b judged the
great c whore, which did corrupt the
earth with her fornication, and hath
avenged the blood of his servants
at her hand.
3 And again they said, Alleluia.
And her a smoke rose up for ever
and ever.
4 And the four and twenty elders
and the four a beasts fell down and
worshipped God that sat on the
throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

5 And a voice came out of the
throne, saying, Praise our God, all
ye his servants, and ye that fear him,
both small and great.
6 And I heard as it were the voice of
a great multitude, and as the voice
of many waters, and as the voice of
mighty thunderings, saying, Alle- luia: for the Lord a God b omnipotent
reigneth.
7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and
give honour to him: for the a marriage
of the b Lamb is come, and his wife
hath made herself ready.
8 And to her was granted that she
should be arrayed in fine linen, clean
and white: for the fine a linen is the b righteousness of saints.
9 And he saith unto me, Write,
Blessed are they which are called
unto the a marriage b supper of the c Lamb. And he saith unto me, These
are the true sayings of God.
10 And I a fell at his feet to b worship
him. And he said unto me, See thou
do it not: I am thy c fellowservant,
and of thy brethren that have the
testimony of Jesus: worship God: for
the d testimony of Jesus is the spirit
of e prophecy.
11 And I saw heaven opened, and
behold a white horse; and he that
sat upon him was called Faithful
and True, and in righteousness he
doth a judge and make b war.
12 His a eyes were as a flame of fire,
and on his head were many crowns;
and he had a b name written, that no
man knew, but he himself.
13 And he was a clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his b name
is called The c Word of God.
14 And the armies which were in
heaven followed him upon white
horses, a clothed in fine linen, white
and clean.
15 a And out of his mouth goeth a
sharp sword, that with it he should
smite the nations: and he shall b rule
them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the c winepress of the fierceness
and wrath of Almighty God.
16 And he hath on his vesture
and on his thigh a name written,
a King of Kings, and b Lord of
Lords.
17 And I saw an angel standing in
the sun; and he cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the fowls that fly
in the midst of heaven, Come and
gather yourselves together unto the
supper of the great God;
18 That ye may eat the flesh of
kings, and the flesh of captains,
and the flesh of mighty men, and
the flesh of horses, and of them
that sit on them, and the flesh of
all a men, both free and bond, both
small and great.
19 And I saw the beast, and the
kings of the earth, and their armies,
gathered together to make war
against him that sat on the horse,
and against his army.

Satan is bound during the Millennium—
The Saints will then live and reign with
Christ—The dead stand before God and
are judged out of the books according
to their works.
And I saw an a angel come down
from heaven, having the key of the
bottomless b pit and a great chain
in his hand.
2 And he laid hold on the dragon,
that old a serpent, which is the b Devil,
and Satan, and c bound him a thou- sand years,
3 And cast him into the bottomless
pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
upon him, that he should deceive the
a nations no more, till the thousand
years should be fulfilled: and after
that he must be b loosed a little season.
4 And I saw thrones, and they sat
upon them, and a judgment was given
unto them: and I saw the souls of
them that were beheaded for the
witness of Jesus, and for the word of
God, and which had not worshipped
the beast, neither his image, neither
had received his mark upon their
foreheads, or in their hands; and
they lived and b reigned with Christ
a c thousand years.
5 But the rest of the a dead lived
not again until the thousand years
were finished. This is the first resurrection.
6 a Blessed and holy is he that hath
part in the b first c resurrection: on
such the d second death hath no
power, but they shall be e priests of
God and of Christ, and shall reign
with him a thousand years.
7 And when the a thousand years
are expired, b Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison,
8 And shall go out to deceive the
nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, a Gog and Magog,
to gather them together to battle:
the number of whom is as the sand
of the sea.
9 And they went up on the breadth
of the earth, and compassed the
camp of the saints about, and the
beloved city: and fire came down
from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
10 And the a devil that deceived
them was b cast into the lake of c fire
and brimstone, where the beast and
the false prophet are, and shall be
tormented day and night for ever
and ever.

Those who overcome will be sons of
God—The earth attains its celestial
glory.
And I saw a a new b heaven and a new c earth: for the first heaven and the
first d earth were passed away; and
there was no more sea.
2 And I John saw the holy city, a new b Jerusalem, coming down from God
out of heaven, prepared as a c bride
adorned for her husband.
3 And I heard a great voice out of
heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will a dwell with them, and they shall be
his people, and b God himself shall
be with them, and be their God.
4 And God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; and there shall be
no more a death, neither b sorrow, nor
crying, neither shall there be any
more c pain: for the former things
are passed away.
5 And he that sat upon the throne
said, Behold, I make all things a new.
And he said unto me, b Write: for
these c words are true and faithful.
6 And he said unto me, It is done. a I am b Alpha and Omega, the begin- ning and the end. I will give unto
him that is athirst of the fountain
of the c water of life freely.
7 He that a overcometh shall b inherit c all things; and I will be his
God, and he shall be my d son.
8 But the fearful, and a unbelieving,
and the abominable, and b murder- ers, and c whoremongers, and d sorcerers, and idolaters, and all e liars,
shall have their part in the lake
which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the f second g death.
9 And there came unto me one of
the seven angels which had the seven
vials full of the seven last a plagues,
and talked with me, saying, Come
hither, I will shew thee the bride,
the Lamb’s wife.
10 And he carried me away in the
spirit to a great and high a mountain,
and shewed me that great city, the

holy b Jerusalem, descending out of
heaven from God,
11 Having the a glory of God: and
her light was like unto a stone most
precious, even like a jasper stone,
clear as crystal;
12 And had a wall great and high,
and had twelve a gates, and at the gates
twelve angels, and names written
thereon, which are the names of the
twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
13 On the east three gates; on the
north three gates; on the south three
gates; and on the west three gates.
14 And the wall of the city had
twelve foundations, and in them
the names of the twelve apostles
of the Lamb.
15 And he that talked with me
had a golden reed to measure the
city, and the gates thereof, and the
wall thereof.
16 And the city lieth foursquare,
and the a length is as large as the
breadth: and he measured the city
with the reed, twelve thousand b fur- longs. The length and the breadth
and the height of it are equal.
17 And he measured the wall
thereof, an hundred and forty and
four cubits, according to the measure
of a man, that is, of the angel.
18 And the building of the wall
of it was of jasper: and the city was
pure gold, like unto clear glass.
19 And the foundations of the wall
of the city were garnished with all
manner of precious stones. The first
foundation was jasper; the second,
sapphire; the third, a chalcedony;
the fourth, an emerald;
20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth,
sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the
eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the
tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh,
a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
21 And the twelve gates were twelve
pearls; every several gate was of one
pearl: and the street of the city was
pure a gold, as it were transparent b glass.
22 And I saw no temple therein:
for the Lord God a Almighty and the
Lamb are the b temple of it.
23 And the city had no need of
the a sun, neither of the moon, to
shine in it: for the glory of God did
lighten it, and the b Lamb is the c light
thereof.
24 And the nations of them which
are saved shall a walk in the light of
it: and the b kings of the c earth do
bring their glory and honour into it.
25 And the a gates of it shall not be
shut at all by day: for there shall be
no night there.
26 And they shall bring the glory
and honour of the nations into it.
27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that a defileth,
neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they
which are written in the Lamb’s
b book of life.
Chapter 22
The Saints will reign in celestial splendor—Christ will come, and men will
be judged—Blessed are they who keep
His commandments.
And he shewed me a pure river of a water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
and of the Lamb.
2 In the midst of the street of it, and
on either side of the river, was there
the a tree of b life, which bare twelve
manner of fruits, and yielded her
fruit every month: and the c leaves
of the tree were for the healing of
the nations.

servants shall serve him:

6 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and a true: and the
Lord God of the holy prophets sent
his angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must b shortly be
done.
7 Behold, I a come quickly: b blessed
is he that keepeth the c sayings of
the prophecy of this book.
8 And I John saw these things, and
heard them. And when I had heard
and seen, I a fell down to worship
before the feet of the angel which
shewed me these things.
9 Then saith he unto me, See thou
do it not: for I am thy fellowservant,
and of thy brethren the prophets,
and of them which keep the sayings
of this book: worship God.
10 And he saith unto me, Seal not
the sayings of the prophecy of this
book: for the time is at hand.
11 He that is a unjust, let him be b unjust still: and he which is c filthy,
let him be filthy still: and he that is
righteous, let him be righteous still:
and he that is holy, let him be holy
still.
12 And, behold, I a come quickly;
and my b reward is with me, to give
every man according as his c work
shall be.
13 I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end, the a first
and the last.
14 Blessed are they that a do his b commandments, that they may
have right to the tree of life, and
may enter in through the gates into
the city.
15 For without are dogs, and a sorcerers, and b whoremongers, and c murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a d lie.
16 I Jesus have sent mine a angel
to testify unto you these things in
the churches. I am the b root and the
offspring of David, and the bright
and morning c star.
17 And the Spirit and the bride
say, a Come. And let him that heareth
say, Come. And let him that is athirst
come. And whosoever will, let him
take the b water of life freely.
18 For I testify unto every man that
heareth the words of the prophecy
of this book, If any man shall a add
unto these things, God shall add unto
him the b plagues that are written
in this book:
19 And if any man shall take away
from the words of the book of this
prophecy, God shall take away his
